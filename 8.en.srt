(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,009
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,040
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:22,129
I'm sorry to tell you...

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,059
that you've lost the baby.

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,870
However, ma'am... The problem is...

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,769
that it looks like you won't be able to get pregnant from now on...

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,369
due to low function in your ovaries.

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,609
The normal range for AMH is between 2 and 5.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,350
But in your case, that number is seriously low.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,579
You're close to menopause already.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,679
In that case, even IVF would be hard to do.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,020
Yes, I understand.

14
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:51,320
Thank you, doctor.

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,429
Okay, then.

16
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:13,950
Get some rest.

17
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,060
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,969
Oh, my.

19
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,710
Hey.

20
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,050
Who are you?

21
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,800
He's Prosecutor Choi's child. Please take good care of him.

22
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,270
Your pupil, Young Ja.

23
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,289
Gosh.

24
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,810
Jae Jin.

25
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,050
It's fine as long as you don't know.

26
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,150
(Chapter 8: The Swamp of Motherly Love)

27
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,560
(Lee Se Na)

28
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,969
(Lee Se Na)

29
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,080
Did you really kill her?

30
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:01,949
What are you saying?

31
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:07,090
Are you saying I killed my sister?

32
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:10,759
How does it feel to know that someone knows your secret?

33
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,159
No.

34
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,060
You're doing this when you don't know anything.

35
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,529
Is that so?

36
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,159
Then, what is the reason you're calling me...

37
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,569
in this frazzled state?

38
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,740
You liked your sister quite a lot.

39
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,138
I think that was the cause...

40
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,279
of your abnormal obsession with love.

41
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,850
"Abnormal?"

42
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,420
What do you know?

43
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,389
Your parents, your sister,

44
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,250
and your three husbands.

45
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,689
Did they really all die coincidentally?

46
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,529
Why is it that all of your family members...

47
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,930
end up dying like that?

48
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,560
That's not true.

49
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:02,040
Then, take a look at what your family is like.

50
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,680
You asked if family must know all of each other's secrets.

51
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,810
Is that really true?

52
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,550
You get disappointed in each other and can't forgive one another.

53
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,490
But you keep everything hidden.

54
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:16,750
I see.

55
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,160
So that was your objective.

56
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:22,459
To see me crumble because of my family's secrets.

57
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,560
But I'm sorry to tell you.

58
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,029
I have no intention of doing that.

59
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,709
That must be because you don't know everything just yet.

60
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,779
The game will now start to get fun.

61
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,779
The way you do things is wrong.

62
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,649
Is that so? Then watch closely.

63
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,360
Oh, Ms. No. What brings you here?

64
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,069
You must've been very shocked by what happened yesterday.

65
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,100
I'll admit to everything.

66
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,399
I knew about it too.

67
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:43,139
There's definitive proof. You don't have to admit anything.

68
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,379
But...

69
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,379
nothing would change...

70
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,779
because I knew about it.

71
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,750
You wanted to join our family too.

72
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,189
Of course.

73
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,519
I wanted to accept you as family too.

74
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,560
So, we...

75
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,029
chose each other.

76
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,699
What makes me mad, Mother,

77
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,299
is your plan that made me live in the same house...

78
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,639
as those who drove my father to his death.

79
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,209
How could you go that far?

80
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,980
I can do it.

81
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,149
I did that for my family...

82
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,578
No. For my family, I could do anything,

83
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:25,920
even worse things.

84
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,389
You're also a mother who's raising a child.

85
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm sure you understand. Right?

86
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,959
This is all because of that insolent girl, Lee Se Na.

87
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,180
Do you know what this is?

88
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,579
A CCTV camera?

89
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,319
Lee Se Na was spying on this house through this camera.

90
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:02,649
But if she installed these,

91
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:06,290
that means there's someone in this house who's helping her out.

92
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,259
Oh, Lord.

93
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,459
We should take care of this first together.

94
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,370
You should be the one to find them.

95
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,970
Everyone in this house is your creation.

96
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,449
How dare she give me orders?

97
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,220
Does she think I'll do what she tells me to?

98
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,919
I am doing this of my own free will.

99
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,559
Have a seat.

100
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,350
We found hidden cameras throughout the house.

101
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,850
Where?

102
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,220
But who would do such a thing?

103
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,519
You're not...

104
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,559
suspecting us, are you?

105
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,860
Madam, we're upset.

106
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,659
No, I'm only saying this because I don't suspect you.

107
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,369
Seeing how the security system did not go off,

108
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,139
I don't think there was an intruder.

109
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,509
I'm just wondering if there were any suspicious moments.

110
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,840
Well, this house doesn't get very many guests.

111
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,179
The only person who visited recently...

112
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,220
was Dr. Oh.

113
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,320
Oh Ji Eun, you say?

114
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,120
But Dr. Oh is like family. I doubt it was her.

115
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,519
Someone who has fairly easy access to the house as an outsider...

116
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,730
is Mr. Moon, actually.

117
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,330
In fact, I wasn't going to say this,

118
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,128
but when you and Dr. No aren't around,

119
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:56,799
he acts like he owns the house.

120
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,840
- Tae Oh does? - Yes.

121
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,610
Oh, and... Right. Mr. An.

122
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:04,240
You said someone left something strange in the mailbox, right?

123
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,480
What strange thing?

124
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,679
A book arrived for Ms. No.

125
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,120
Oh, that book.

126
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,750
"The Mousetrap Has Gone Missing." I know that.

127
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,019
I'll pay more attention to security.

128
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,888
Have you reported it to the police? I bet you have. Right.

129
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,629
But exactly where did you find this camera?

130
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Don't tell me it was the bathroom or anywhere private.

131
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,939
I did the best I could to clean every corner of the house.

132
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,070
But I never spotted anything that looked like a secret camera.

133
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,168
I'm sorry. I should've been more thorough and meticulous.

134
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,210
Be quiet.

135
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,139
Okay.

136
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,919
It's started to snow heavily in the capital area.

137
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,259
Please be careful when you're out until late at night.

138
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,199
This snow will expand more to the west during the night.

139
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,869
On Ulleung Island and Dok Island, it's expected to snow...

140
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,298
up to 10cm by tomorrow.

141
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:05,439
Also in the capital area and the middle west area,

142
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,439
it will snow up to 5cm,

143
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,908
and in the southwestern area,

144
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:11,439
around 1 cm of snow is expected.

145
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,079
The temperature will drop along with the snow.

146
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,979
- Ji Eun? - In Seoul, it'll be minus 6°C...

147
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,278
- in the morning... - Jae Jin.

148
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,219
and minus 2°C in the afternoon.

149
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,489
In two days on Monday, it will drop to minus 10°C.

150
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,449
- It's expected... - What are you doing here?

151
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,559
to be freezing.

152
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,220
Tomorrow, the sky will be...

153
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,559
Did you move out of the house?

154
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:33,929
You should've called me right away.

155
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,370
Ji Eun.

156
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,070
Se Na disappeared.

157
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,570
I thought you broke up with her.

158
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,940
We got back together.

159
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:47,548
But I can't reach her.

160
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:49,409
You need to snap out of it.

161
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,349
She's a little weird.

162
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,819
She struck me with a shovel as soon as she saw me.

163
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,048
That's because you tried to hurt her first.

164
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,690
You don't believe me?

165
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,959
Why on earth would I lie to you?

166
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,489
She wouldn't do such a thing.

167
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,559
What are you talking about?

168
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,528
Goodness. Ji Eun, don't add more to this.

169
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,669
I'm already having a hard time.

170
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,820
I see Madam Hong...

171
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,720
and Ms. No told you off a lot.

172
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,360
On top of that, you can't reach Lee Se Na.

173
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,960
I'll look into it.

174
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:42,899
Look at me.

175
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,500
It's all right.

176
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:49,070
Goodness.

177
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,980
Let's brace you up first.

178
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:56,779
Did you eat anything?

179
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,080
This won't do.

180
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,820
I'll get you something to eat. Okay?

181
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,100
When Father-in-law passed away,

182
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:15,299
he was wrongly framed.

183
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,100
My father was involved in doing so.

184
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,289
(I'm visiting Mom. Do you want to join me?)

185
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,058
- Mom. Where? Here? - Just move one.

186
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:46,729
- Here? - No, just one.

187
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,768
- Oh, here? - That's right.

188
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:48,899
I see.

189
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,100
- Now, pull out the needle. - Okay.

190
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,370
Doctor.

191
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:02,109
You should've called me beforehand.

192
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,320
I was already on my way. I missed Mom.

193
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,149
Doctor.

194
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,720
He looks quite unwell, doesn't he?

195
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,898
So I was teaching him how to cross-stitch.

196
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,200
I see. Good job.

197
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,729
What the... She doesn't remember any of us,

198
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,740
so why does she treat you as a doctor and me as a patient?

199
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,639
Mom.

200
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,039
Am I sick?

201
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,039
Oh, dear.

202
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:34,679
Okay, I'm sick.

203
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,940
You don't understand me, do you?

204
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,539
That I keep facing those people in the same house.

205
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,250
I've hated that family ever since I was little.

206
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,949
When I graduated from high school, entered college,

207
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,250
and even joined the military,

208
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,959
Mom was hospitalized...

209
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,820
and you couldn't make it to any of those ceremonies.

210
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,929
Now in this situation, you want to protect that family?

211
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:26,659
Don't you feel sorry to Dad?

212
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,639
You know why she had to do that.

213
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,439
You know why she got married at such a young age...

214
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,039
and joined that family.

215
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,149
It was because of money.

216
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,580
Because of my hospital bills and your tuition.

217
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:50,120
She did that to protect us. You know it!

218
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,860
Guess what she said back then.

219
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,929
She said that it was the best choice she could make.

220
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:06,340
My heart shatters...

221
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,909
whenever I think of your sister.

222
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,949
To think of how hard that little thing must've tried...

223
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,080
to win their favour, I...

224
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,758
How dare you raise your voice at your sister?

225
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,090
Apologize to her already. Now.

226
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,100
Goodness.

227
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,899
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,269
Mom, are you back for a second?

229
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,509
- I love you. - Mom.

230
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,090
Gosh. Why are you hugging me?

231
00:16:58,419 --> 00:16:59,519
Doctor.

232
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,059
He's shedding tears.

233
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,000
See? I told you. He's definitely not well.

234
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,640
Don't cry.

235
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,549
Let me be honest with you.

236
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,950
I was sure that I could leave that family...

237
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,890
at any time if my marriage had issues.

238
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,490
I didn't understand those who put up with their marriage...

239
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,400
for their children's sake.

240
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,559
But...

241
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:43,930
when it actually became my situation,

242
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,869
I realized how difficult it was.

243
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:48,940
Is it because of Do Hyun?

244
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,579
You know me.

245
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,579
In any case, I make sure to do what I put my mind to.

246
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,880
But now isn't the time.

247
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,118
There's another problem.

248
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:03,589
Another issue came up in that family?

249
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:06,890
The truth is,

250
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,229
Lee Se Na is blackmailing our family.

251
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,329
Lee Se Na?

252
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,170
She's Jae Jin's mistress.

253
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,470
He's back, so isn't it over?

254
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
No.

255
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:24,440
Everything was her plan.

256
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,509
Taking down the family one after another.

257
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,450
Does it mean she killed your father-in-law?

258
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,220
I'm not sure about that.

259
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,690
Goodness, gracious.

260
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:43,859
But why would she blackmail you?

261
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,029
That's my point.

262
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:47,660
I need to figure that out.

263
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,569
And then,

264
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,170
I'll make her pay for what she did.

265
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,710
Goodness. Your life is just too thorny.

266
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:02,609
Is there anything I can help you with?

267
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,088
So you think someone's helping her from within the family?

268
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:10,150
Yes.

269
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:12,619
The culprit is nearby.

270
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,259
Someone put something in the postbox about five days ago.

271
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,930
Can you look into things around that time?

272
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:26,500
The district police station might have the footage near your house.

273
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:31,910
Gu Kyung Tae who joined the police after 15 years of studying.

274
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:35,809
Does he still think you're Oh Ji Eun's uncle?

275
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,180
Yes. I'll try that route.

276
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,048
Lee Se Na set her house on fire?

277
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,990
I'll have to look into it more.

278
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,829
The charging process is complete.

279
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,359
It's all done.

280
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,549
- Aren't we there yet? - No.

281
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,759
(Reliable Police, Safe Country)

282
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,740
Yeong Won.

283
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,309
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

284
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,849
Did you mention Gangneung family fire incident?

285
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,319
Yes.

286
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,990
Why are you asking about this case?

287
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,960
Dr. No's writing a book...

288
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,160
about children who lost their families.

289
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,329
You're after a good deed.

290
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,259
What do you want to know in particular?

291
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,599
At the time, the whole family was said to be dead.

292
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,299
Then I heard there was a survivor.

293
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,369
Well...

294
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,970
You're right.

295
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,579
The name is Lee Se Na. The second daughter.

296
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,650
Do you know anyone who might know what she was like...

297
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,049
after the accident or her condition at the time?

298
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,490
The detective in charge was...

299
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,619
Cha Min Gu.

300
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,519
He thought it was arson.

301
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,190
Arson?

302
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:32,000
You mean someone started the fire?

303
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,700
Why did he think it was arson?

304
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,269
This happened 14 years ago,

305
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,440
and he doesn't work here anymore.

306
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:40,769
Do you know...

307
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:44,269
anyone who might know him?

308
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,109
Yes, you're right.

309
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,778
Min Gu was obsessed with that case.

310
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,109
He kept arguing it was arson.

311
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,250
Why did he think it was arson?

312
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:53,920
It might be the detective's hunch.

313
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,348
Anyway, I didn't get why he was so obsessed with that case.

314
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,519
In the end, he closed the case and moved somewhere else.

315
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,390
Where is Detective Cha now?

316
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,000
I heard he moved to Yongin Police Station before his retirement.

317
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,700
Thank you.

318
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:15,940
I'll call you after I arrive in Yongin.

319
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,480
Yes, Young Min. I appreciate it.

320
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,210
Bye.

321
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,319
Dr. No. You have a guest.

322
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,089
Hello.

323
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,970
Do Hyun told me a lot about you.

324
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,400
What did he say?

325
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,670
That there's a girl he likes,

326
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,910
and she's pretty and smart.

327
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
I see.

328
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,109
What brings you here?

329
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:57,950
I had something to tell you.

330
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,319
About Do Hyun you're not aware of.

331
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,890
About Do Hyun?

332
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:08,589
Do you know...

333
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,660
everything about Do Hyun?

334
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,130
Do you know everything about your family?

335
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,880
What are you saying?

336
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,539
Did someone order you?

337
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:28,950
What are you doing?

338
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,650
I'm pregnant.

339
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:34,819
What?

340
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,720
I'm pregnant with Do Hyun's child.

341
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,039
I thought you'd be...

342
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:54,470
less surprised.

343
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,869
Have you seen a doctor?

344
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,180
You don't trust me, do you?

345
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,880
Well, that's not it.

346
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,049
It's understandable.

347
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,380
That's why...

348
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,950
(Seoul Bright Heart OB-GYN Clinic)

349
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,829
It's been 11 weeks.

350
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,299
Does Do Hyun know?

351
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,970
He's the father. Of course he knows.

352
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,000
Then are you two...

353
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,369
Yes, we're having the baby.

354
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,680
I respect your opinion,

355
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:43,349
but you shouldn't make that decision so easily.

356
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,719
Considering school and...

357
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,289
I didn't decide it easily.

358
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,490
Send us to school abroad.

359
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:52,299
We'll have the baby abroad.

360
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
Abroad?

361
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,529
Well, if we stay here...

362
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,269
You know, people will stare at us.

363
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,670
What?

364
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,710
You wouldn't tell me...

365
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,619
to abort the baby, right?

366
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,549
So Yi.

367
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,019
Having a child and becoming a parent...

368
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:24,930
isn't as easy as it sounds.

369
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:31,230
Your life might head in a totally different direction.

370
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,200
I'm old enough to know that.

371
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,039
Did you think it was an easy decision...

372
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:39,509
for me to become a mom when I'm only 19?

373
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,750
Do your parents know?

374
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,519
I'm telling you first,

375
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,289
so when you get a call from my mom, you'll know what to say.

376
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:00,259
When this happens,

377
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,700
it's more shocking for a girl's mom.

378
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,609
I'm off to the academy now.

379
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,640
I'm going home after meeting your mom.

380
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,349
So Yi told my mom.

381
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,319
So she told her.

382
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,420
She followed the plan after all.

383
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,200
What did your mom say?

384
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,960
She was probably surprised.

385
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:12,799
But will your mom go as you planned?

386
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,569
Mom always said she wanted me to be honest.

387
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:20,039
That's what moms say.

388
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,079
"Please don't lie."

389
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,480
"I won't get upset, so be honest with me."

390
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,519
So if you tell her everything honestly,

391
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,990
they get upset and yell at you just as expected.

392
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,289
No wonder you'd feel betrayed.

393
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,869
You'll get to see what your mom's really like.

394
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,640
Welcome home.

395
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,140
Oh, Do Hyun's getting tutored.

396
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:55,680
Okay.

397
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:07,420
Gosh.

398
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,380
Ms. No?

399
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:39,589
Mother.

400
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,990
Ms. No.

401
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,230
Are you pregnant with a second child?

402
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:48,129
No.

403
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,900
Then? Is it Lee Se Na?

404
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,240
No.

405
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,869
Then?

406
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,950
It's Do Hyun.

407
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,009
Do Hyun's girlfriend is pregnant.

408
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,980
Oh, Lord.

409
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,390
How many weeks?

410
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:11,519
- Eleven weeks. - Eleven weeks.

411
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,970
You're a doctor, so you know...

412
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,069
she can abort it before 24 weeks.

413
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,670
- Mother. - What?

414
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:30,669
Are you going to let her have it?

415
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,739
Don't say that so easily.

416
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,150
If I say this the hard way, does it solve the problem?

417
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,679
No parent is reasonable when it comes to their children.

418
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,278
Think about his future.

419
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,079
We have to listen to what Do Hyun has to say first.

420
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,490
See?

421
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,690
Your child never goes as you planned.

422
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:51,490
You're a talented family affair counsellor outside.

423
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,160
But look what happened to your family.

424
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:19,359
So Yi came by to my clinic today.

425
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,359
Is what she said true?

426
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,329
Yes.

427
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,630
It's just as you heard from her.

428
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:37,169
How could such a rational boy as you...

429
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,880
Does being rational make someone immune from sexual desires?

430
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,419
What I mean is, I'm curious if you discussed and agreed...

431
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,119
on the possibility of a pregnancy...

432
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,450
and if you really thought about the decision you made.

433
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:52,318
That's what I want to know.

434
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,190
Who says I didn't think about it carefully?

435
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,490
It's my choice to make. I thought you respected that.

436
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,569
Forget it. I'll talk to Dad separately.

437
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:09,470
Man to man.

438
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,700
Can you step outside for a minute?

439
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:21,440
Look at the state you're in.

440
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,380
I get that you're suffering.

441
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:29,549
Let's go home now. How much longer will you stay here?

442
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,490
You should go home.

443
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:35,858
And please let me go now.

444
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,789
What kind of parent gives up on her child?

445
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,848
Did Yeong Won perhaps...

446
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,910
It's Do Hyun.

447
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,619
But when did this kid...

448
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:06,519
Don't you think he needs his dad in this situation?

449
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,690
I know you resent me and want to be set free.

450
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,400
But put those feelings aside for a little while.

451
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,069
That is what you must do as a parent right now.

452
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:21,900
Finish your shave and come on out.

453
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:25,940
Why, this little...

454
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,419
Madam, I...

455
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,289
You. What are you even thinking?

456
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,430
After seeing all of that, you still let Jae Jin stay here?

457
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,299
You should've sent him back home.

458
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,400
This is why I can't trust you for certain.

459
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,579
Jae Jin...

460
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,030
(J Plastic and Reconstruction Surgery Center)

461
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:01,199
What did you bring him home for?

462
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,479
Didn't Do Hyun ask for his dad?

463
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,710
That he wanted to talk to him man to man.

464
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,010
- And you overheard that too. - What matters is...

465
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,679
that family must band together in times like these.

466
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,050
Have you met with that girl's mother?

467
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,619
I'm going to meet her tomorrow.

468
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,260
No matter where you go, people will recognize your face.

469
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,230
You should meet somewhere private so that word doesn't get out.

470
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,469
I will make a reservation for you.

471
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,880
You had me when you were 24 years old too.

472
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,819
How big a difference is 24 and 18?

473
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,089
Hey, but your mom and I were already in med school by then.

474
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,090
Neither of us were in high school.

475
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,789
Gosh, I can't believe you.

476
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,960
- Goodness gracious. - But Dad,

477
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,259
weren't you happy because I was in your life?

478
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,729
Hey, that's cheating.

479
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,569
I'm doing this so that I can be happy too.

480
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,929
- Hey... - You told me...

481
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,269
to live the life I want.

482
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,280
So,

483
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:24,889
is this the life you want?

484
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,690
- Yes. - But do you have to live abroad?

485
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,690
Dad, you know Jun O, right?

486
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,659
Yes.

487
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,829
The three of us will get back together again.

488
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,300
So, you want to go to the US where Jun O is?

489
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:42,239
Yes.

490
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,380
You'll be on my side, won't you, Dad?

491
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,409
Hello, this is Moon Tae Oh.

492
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,320
How did you get my number?

493
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,519
Oh, Jae Jin wanted to tell you that he was sorry.

494
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,429
I saw him at the house today.

495
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,289
Is Jae Jin okay?

496
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:16,300
Of course not. Dr. Oh, you're upset, right?

497
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:18,030
To see Mr. Choi live like that?

498
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:20,400
You can tell me.

499
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,239
Mr. Choi told me everything, that he's suffering.

500
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,880
What happened with Lee Se Na?

501
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,550
He must not be able to reach her.

502
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,718
I think she might've abandoned him.

503
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,650
Why would Jae Jin fall for that weird woman...

504
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,690
He said that someone had saved him.

505
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:46,399
When I see Mr. Choi locked up in that house right now,

506
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,099
it makes me wonder if it would've been better for him to just leave.

507
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,199
Now, who will save Mr. Choi?

508
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:24,369
(Just and Kind Police of Civilians)

509
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:27,169
I only heard that Detective Cha retired...

510
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,369
and is raising deer at a ranch nearby.

511
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:31,809
A deer ranch?

512
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,179
What is this?

513
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:36,179
There are so many deer ranches.

514
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:39,419
Hey, why do you look so down?

515
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,750
Where is that passion of ours?

516
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,349
We should just call all of these deer ranches. Let's go.

517
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,260
Let's go. Right.

518
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,260
- Have a nice, cold beverage. - Oh, thanks.

519
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,570
- By the way, Uncle... - Yes?

520
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,209
Why do you need to see CCTV footage of the camera overlooking the house?

521
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,210
Oh, that.

522
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:15,150
Recently, someone left an odd piece of mail in the mailbox.

523
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,019
Whose house is it?

524
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,960
They're practically like my own family.

525
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,130
Do this for me, my nephew-in-law.

526
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,889
What? Nephew-in-law?

527
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,760
Gosh, of course.

528
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,968
I should help you out since we're family.

529
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,030
Of course.

530
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,199
Cheers.

531
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,780
(Soft Hands)

532
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,550
You should meet somewhere private so that word doesn't get out.

533
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,550
I will make a reservation for you.

534
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,420
(Soft Hands)

535
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,980
Hello.

536
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,150
I didn't know you were coming too.

537
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:24,849
I thought your mother-in-law came because you couldn't make it.

538
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,488
I guess the two of you are on good terms.

539
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:28,789
You even do something like this together.

540
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,389
Because we're family.

541
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,570
Ms. No,

542
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:42,299
you should know better about education, so how...

543
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,369
Educating children doesn't always go as you plan.

544
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,210
You didn't educate your daughter to get pregnant, I presume.

545
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,619
Anyway, what are you going to do?

546
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,518
So Yi is a senior in high school.

547
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:01,289
She's busy preparing for her college entrance exam.

548
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,059
Is it confirmed that she's pregnant with my grandson's baby?

549
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,429
Are you saying my daughter is lying?

550
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:09,159
Should we run a paternity test or something?

551
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:12,030
It's illegal to run a paternity test on an unborn baby.

552
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:22,210
Did you hear their opinion?

553
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,349
They want to go abroad to study and have the baby there.

554
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,250
Well...

555
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,420
It'd be nice to send them abroad.

556
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,960
So Yi has always wanted to study abroad.

557
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,960
Then again,

558
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:38,030
it's not a bad idea if we'll marry them off anyway.

559
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,230
Marry?

560
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,670
You can't dare ruin my grandson's future.

561
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,239
It's rather my daughter whose future is to be ruined.

562
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,439
Honestly speaking, the son's side bears no risks...

563
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,969
once the baby is aborted.

564
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,940
But it's different for the daughter's side.

565
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,550
We bear risks whether she gives birth or not.

566
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,719
Have you heard of this story?

567
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,619
In Gangnam these days, a late baby in a family...

568
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,289
is actually from their teenage son.

569
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:08,788
In case the baby ruins their teenage son's future,

570
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:11,130
they register the birth of their grandchild as their own.

571
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,400
This baby is of your blood.

572
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:16,929
Why don't we take that measure to be nice and clear?

573
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,969
Please calm down.

574
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:22,199
How about 500,000 dollars to be nice and clear?

575
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:24,769
Mother!

576
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,980
What...

577
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,690
This isn't a matter of money.

578
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:42,489
Dr. No, I thought your family would be better.

579
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,630
Wait...

580
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,300
Mother. Please stay out of this.

581
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:50,800
It's about my son.

582
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,669
(Soft Hands)

583
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,510
I'm sorry.

584
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,750
I don't want to talk any more with you today.

585
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:19,329
(Young Min)

586
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,230
Mr. Park.

587
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,230
Yes, ma'am.

588
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,699
Look into that family.

589
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:29,369
Sure.

590
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:47,719
Hello, sir.

591
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,730
- We asked to visit you today. - Oh, yes.

592
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,260
Hello.

593
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:56,368
I've seen you on TV.

594
00:44:56,369 --> 00:44:58,369
What brought you to a place like this?

595
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,039
I came to ask you...

596
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:04,670
about the family fire accident from 14 years ago.

597
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,309
It's a closed case, so why...

598
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:11,150
At that time, you saw it as an arson case.

599
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,679
May I ask why?

600
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:19,050
Why do you want to know about it?

601
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,090
Well...

602
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:27,130
The family's second daughter who was the only survivor...

603
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,698
is currently one of my patients.

604
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:30,869
I don't want to know anything about that girl.

605
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,698
Leave now.

606
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:34,538
- Sir. - Leave.

607
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:37,038
- But... - I said leave.

608
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:38,408
- Sir. - Now.

609
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:39,480
The truth is,

610
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,550
I lied. I'm sorry.

611
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,820
Lee Se Na...

612
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,219
is blackmailing my son.

613
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,760
Please help.

614
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,809
It's that house.

615
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:13,010
They're struggling financially due to a business failure.

616
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,480
Her dad filed for bankruptcy and ran off.

617
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,050
Her mom couldn't leave Gangnam because of her daughter.

618
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:22,449
And so they live here.

619
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:26,190
Did we turn off the heater when we stepped out?

620
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:28,789
We did.

621
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,760
She wasn't the only survivor.

622
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,900
Pardon?

623
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,800
Lee Se Na wasn't the only survivor.

624
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,940
Her older sister was alive.

625
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,710
At first, she was in a coma.

626
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:46,280
So reporters...

627
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,309
wrote that the whole family had died.

628
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,880
Did she know that her sister was alive?

629
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,989
Her sister's condition was grave,

630
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:00,820
so she must've been greatly shocked.

631
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:05,960
Then dramatically enough, her sister regained consciousness.

632
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,460
But...

633
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:13,170
she asked me to keep her survival a secret.

634
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,409
At first, I simply thought she was shocked due to the fire.

635
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,710
And she said...

636
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,349
that her younger sister set the house on fire.

637
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,690
That she tried to kill their parents.

638
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,719
That it was all because of her.

639
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,760
- So... - So,

640
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:42,500
I was going to hide it and reinvestigate the case.

641
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,800
But Lee Se Na got adopted.

642
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,170
That was how the case was closed.

643
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,780
Did Lee Se Na find her older sister after then?

644
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,650
She might have tried.

645
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,949
But she must not have been able to find her.

646
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,150
Oh, right.

647
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,889
Here. Try visiting her.

648
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:19,429
(Yangpyeong-gun, Songi-myun Gajang-ro 18-1)

649
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,880
(My Son)

650
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,018
- Do Hyun. - How could you do that, Mom?

651
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:35,119
- Do Hyun. - Let go.

652
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:37,649
Did you offer money in exchange for the abortion?

653
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,819
What are you talking about?

654
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,519
They wrote a promise that they'd abort the baby in return for money!

655
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,058
I never did such a thing.

656
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:45,130
If this is a lie, I won't forgive you.

657
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,300
Do Hyun.

658
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,570
Mother, what is wrong with you?

659
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:57,110
I handled it.

660
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:58,869
We can prevent further trouble this way.

661
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:02,479
She'd resent her parents for accepting money.

662
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,308
I told you to stay out of this one.

663
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,449
It's what her parents wanted.

664
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,348
No parent would want their high school child...

665
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:12,250
to give birth to a baby.

666
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,260
And her family needed money.

667
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,860
You should be honest too.

668
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,198
You don't want Do Hyun to be a dad, do you?

669
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:22,000
That's right. I hate the idea.

670
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,800
I'm scared and terrified because I know what awaits him.

671
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,500
But what scares me more...

672
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,539
is that he might detest me for the decision I make.

673
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,839
That scares me more.

674
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,578
Nevertheless, you must make a decision on your child's behalf...

675
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:35,738
as a mother.

676
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,379
You think you can make decisions...

677
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,849
for your child's life.

678
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,679
I'm not like you.

679
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:44,389
I respect my son's ideas and decisions.

680
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:47,190
I won't follow your ways.

681
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,389
I'll raise and protect my son my way.

682
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,329
Stay out of anything that involves Do Hyun.

683
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,569
How can I possibly do that? It's about my grandson.

684
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,170
It's about this family.

685
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,670
What about this family?

686
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:03,940
What's so great about this family that deceives one another?

687
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,880
Ms. No. I'm not done talking.

688
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:18,179

691
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,690

693
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:50,909
Maternal instinct is such a beautiful but sad thing, isn't it?

694
00:52:18,909 --> 00:52:19,980
Do Hyun.

695
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,610
I will support your decision.

696
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,989
- Really? - Yes.

697
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,090
There will be a lot of hardship that you two will go through.

698
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,929
But no matter how this world sees the two of you,

699
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,469
I will protect you.

700
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:52,969
Thank you, Mom.

702
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,980
This is what she said.

703
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:02,639
That her younger sister set the house on fire.

704
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,808
That she tried to kill their parents.

705
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,449
That it was all because of her.

706
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:09,119
Dr. No is doing this without even knowing anything.

707

(Yangpyeong-gun, Songi-myun Gajang-ro 18-1)

708
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:35,809
Excuse me.

709
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:38,780
How may I help you?

710
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:42,250
I'm here to meet Ms. Lee Se Eun.

711
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:46,420
Why are you looking for Se Eun?

712
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,420
I have something to tell her about her family.

713
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,900
Follow me.

714
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,280
Sister Maria. Someone has come to meet you.

("No Yeong Won's Everlasting Solution")

716
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,130
Se Eun.

717
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,530
Feel comfortable when you speak. Okay?

718
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,599
It started with a pigeon.

719
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:42,340
She brought a pigeon with its head cut off to the yard.

720
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,250
She said there was one reason for doing that.

721
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,949
It was...

722
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,090
because I hated pigeons.

723
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:55,860
Her obsession with me got worse...

724
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,030
and became more and more reckless.

725
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,929
The next target was a cat.

726
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,099
And then,

727
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,670
it was the boy next door.

728
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:14,808
My parents started to lock her up after that.

729
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:17,050
They wanted to stop her from committing even more sins.

730
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:21,820
But that night,

731
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:25,550
a fire started.

732
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:37,869
What are you doing?

733
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:42,139
It's your sister who you like so much.

734
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:46,170
Everyone will hear the truth through today's live show.

735
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,880
Liar.

736
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:51,750
Stop lying.

737
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,179
What's wrong? Are you afraid?

738
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,650
You should stop this from happening yourself if you feel afraid.

739
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,519
But you should hurry.

740
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,000

742
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,710
Where is my sister?

743
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:29,139
Are you here to see your sister...

744
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,449
or are you afraid that she's alive?

745
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,480
It must be because you're afraid.

746
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:40,789
She's the only witness who saw what you did that night.

747
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:45,158
Stop saying things without even knowing the truth.

748
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:47,099
Don't you think it was all your fault...

749
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,360
that your family ended up like that?

750
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:52,030
So you're saying it was all my fault too, right?

751
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,469
No. It wasn't my fault.

752
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,539
They didn't accept my love even as my family.

753
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:06,010
That is no reason to burn up your own family.

754
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:09,619
So where is my sister?

755
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,420
It was all a lie.

756
00:59:20,429 --> 00:59:21,900
Your sister is dead.

758
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:24,129
I'll let you be isolated and treated before the world knows about this.

759
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,888
I was just curious.

760
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:28,729
Even after knowing about one's family's dirty secrets,

761
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:32,328
I wondered if someone could easily talk about...

762
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:33,570
someone else's family.

763
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,299
Why didn't you live your own life?

764
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,738
This wasn't the son you wished for.

765
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:42,009
I heard your son was in that situation too.

766
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:44,079
What are you planning to do?

767
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,709
What are you doing?

768
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,179
A person's imagination...

769
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,389
is the scariest thing.
