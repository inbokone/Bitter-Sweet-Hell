1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,009
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,009
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,040
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,150
Isn't that so shocking?

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,219
Prosecutor Choi's death...

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,349
("Murder in a Frame")

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,919
was exactly the same as Novelist Hong's novel.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,149
You know...

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,920
your mother-in-law isn't an ordinary woman.

10
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,289
Are you perhaps suspecting me?

11
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,230
You did hate him that much.

12
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,600
What about you?

13
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:27,899
Do you know everything...

14
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:30,199
about your family?

15
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,369
Along with the strange text,

16
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,670
I got a miniature model of the vacation home.

17
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,210
Dr. Oh had collapsed there,

18
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:40,280
and you were there. Of course it looks strange.

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,749
It wasn't me.

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,280
Are you saying that Jae Jin had an affair or something?

21
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:45,619
Lee Se Na is...

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,420
Dr. Choi's secret mistress.

23
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,789
That was why they were at the vacation home together?

24
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,020
This is what I found out about Lee Se Na.

25
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,759
She's a witch, I tell you.

26
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,899
So all of her husbands have died?

27
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,899
Things might not end here.

28
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,770
(101N 9999)

29
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,399
Dr. Choi Jae Jin could be in danger too.

30
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,739
He just said my Jae Jin is with the witch.

31
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,208
Aren't you even worried about him?

32
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:09,340
Listen, Mother.

33
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:11,179
I feel more anger toward the man...

34
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,810
that has fallen into a woman like her.

35
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,810
So what are you going to do?

36
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,280
I will find him.

37
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,650
Won't it be better for him...

38
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,790
to be killed by me instead of the witch?

39
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,489
Let's look for them together until the end...

40
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,060
without giving up.

41
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,529
(Seoul and Hongcheon, Yangpyeong, Yangpyeong, Yangpyeong and Changwon)

42
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,729
Why don't you look for the director's car first?

43
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,200
He's moving toward the south.

44
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,629
Then the last toll gate was...

45
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,500
Tongyeong.

46
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,239
Were you surprised?

47
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,640
How did you know?

48
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:44,180
Anyway, Ms. No, we're on the same team now.

49
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,048
Shouldn't we find Jae Jin together?

50
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,818
I'm looking for the owner of the car out there.

51
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,519
Didn't he say he was going to Yokji Island?

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,420
Oh, and where is that Yokji Island?

53
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,590
Where are we going now?

54
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,459
Did you find him?

55
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,989
I heard a car was found in the sea.

56
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,009
Help!

57
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,610
Help...

58
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:56,649
- Honey! - What's going on?

59
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,549
- Jae Jin. - What's wrong with him?

60
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,080
- Get him. - What's going on?

61
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,919
- Let's go. - Wake up.

62
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,688
- Help us. - Hurry up.

63
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:04,918
- Go. - Bring him out.

64
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,589
- There we go. - Jae Jin.

65
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,389
- Hello? - Check his tongue.

66
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,500
- Hey. One, two. - Excuse me.

67
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,159
- Give her space. - Go.

68
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,370
Honey!

69
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,409
Hey, Yeong Won.

70
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,780
- Yeong Won. - Honey.

71
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:28,080
I might die because of you.

72
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,150
What?

73
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,319
(Yeong Won, let's love each other forever!)

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,370
Since I was just reborn, I'll love you again like the beginning.

75
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,839
- Yeong Won! - Such a beautiful couple!

76
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,050
You guys are so cool!

77
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,389
My goodness.

78
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,759
Were you very surprised?

79
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,129
I don't even want to speak to you when I think of how you teased me.

80
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,860
What if you actually blacked out while doing that?

81
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,100
You're not angry, are you?

82
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,470
Anyway, if your intention was to scare me,

83
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,898
you did a great job.

84
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,170
Yes, it was a success.

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,739
Imagine if Mother knew about this.

86
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,970
She would've been outraged.

87
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,438
She doesn't even know that I do free diving.

88
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,439
That's right.

89
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:37,480
Mother will never even imagine that her son is lying to her.

90
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,980
By the way,

91
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:43,689
what if our son lies to me later on?

92
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,220
Gosh, no way.

93
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,660
- Right? - Of course not.

94
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:06,980
- This looks good. - Yes.

95
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,149
- Here. - What's this?

96
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,290
- Is this mine? - Yes, it's yours.

97
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:16,689
Open it.

98
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,459
Gosh! Are you surprising me too?

99
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,199
This is the only one of its kind in the world.

100
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,370
- Really? - Yes. If you look here,

101
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,170
I had our anniversary inscribed.

102
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,439
This is so beautiful.

103
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,970
I've been wanting to change my watch to a leather strap.

104
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,939
The metal is too cold in the winter.

105
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,279
This will be the only watch I'll be wearing from now on.

106
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,379
Congratulations on your tenth wedding anniversary.

107
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,850
- Thank you. - Thank you.

108
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,750
Madam Hong has prepared this win for you.

109
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,259
Gosh...

110
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,729
Oh, Mother did?

111
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,759
Yes.

112
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,399
Oh, right.

113
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,300
Then, I hope you enjoy your time.

114
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,470
Right.

115
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,240
You must've told Mother that we were coming here.

116
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,209
No, I didn't.

117
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:17,078
Well, since we come here so often,

118
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,250
she must've checked.

119
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,620
And she knows it's our wedding anniversary too.

120
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:21,819
Right.

121
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,589
Then, I should thank her, at least.

122
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,029
I'll go and call her.

123
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,129
Let me go to the restroom.

124
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,410
A toast.

125
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,759
Aren't you going to the restroom?

126
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,240
(Chapter 5: A Trap)

127
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,209
That's not it, is it?

128
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,050
(83H 2949)

129
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,879
Two-nine-four-nine.

130
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:30,419
It is the car that Dr. Choi rented.

131
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
Oh, my.

132
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,759
Gosh!

133
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,459
Oh, my.

134
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,279
Mother.

135
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,509
- What's going on? - What was that?

136
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,750
- What happened? - A car went into the water?

137
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,319
Gosh, that scared me.

138
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,089
I thought it was a person.

139
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:08,689
There's no one inside.

140
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,528
Well, it is a rental car.

141
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,500
- Hurry up and run the plate number. - Yes, sir.

142
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:14,829
Did the car fall in by itself?

143
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,569
Or did the corpse get lost?

144
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,899
"The corpse?"

145
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,170
"The corpse?"

146
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,509
Oh, my goodness!

147
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:30,649
Are you perhaps...

148
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,720
It's you, right? Dr. No Yeong Won?

149
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,220
Hey, it is her.

150
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,090
Do you perhaps know that car?

151
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,700
(Korea Coast Guard)

152
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,240
Then, since when have you lost contact with Mr. Choi Jae Jin?

153
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:56,870
Since Wednesday night.

154
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,479
Then, it must be right.

155
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,250
I hear he rented this car in Tongyeong on Thursday.

156
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,480
And if you watch the CCTV footage from the dock...

157
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,820
Play it.

158
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,990
Friday morning at 11:09am.

159
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,259
That's the license plate number, right?

160
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:16,230
And this is the footage from the port where the car was found.

161
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,100
See? That's the same car.

162
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,299
After the car came inside the port on Saturday night,

163
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,399
it never left after that.

164
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,240
Then, that means the car went into the water on Saturday night.

165
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,769
So, my Jae Jin... You mean...

166
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,308
Are you sure there was a person inside the car?

167
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,809
It's hard to tell since it was at night, but the circumstances seem...

168
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,149
Well,

169
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,849
it could have been just the car that fell in.

170
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,919
If only the car had fallen in, he would've reported the accident.

171
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,860
Then, what about CCTV cameras inside the port?

172
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,528
There are no CCTV cameras inside the port.

173
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:52,559
Gosh!

174
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,269
Why? Why aren't there any?

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
My goodness...

176
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,440
And what about his whereabouts after that?

177
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,870
We are trying to find out,

178
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,210
- but that might take a while. - How...

179
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,849
How long? Until when?

180
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,279
Please wait a little. Things are hectic for us too.

181
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,989
We need to figure out what happened with the accident,

182
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,120
and if we're to retrieve a corpse from that wide open sea...

183
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:20,119
"A corpse?" How can you say that?

184
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,058
A corpse? You've got to be kidding me!

185
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:25,299
Hey. Well...

186
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,628
Choi Jae Jin and Gesekki...

187
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:31,500
Hey, punk. Watch what you say. They're his family.

188
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,539
No, I wasn't swearing.

189
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,779
Gesekki as in a jjampong place, not a swear word.

190
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,779
You mean, Gesekki Jjamppong?

191
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:44,119
Their food is delicious.

192
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,490
Apparently, Mr. Choi was with a woman.

193
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,819
- A woman? - Yes.

194
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,860
And this morning, her family visited looking for her.

195
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,659
A lady who seemed like her mom...

196
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,529
and a man who made guksu for a living.

197
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,909
Was Mr. Choi with someone?

198
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,309
So in short,

199
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,849
Mr. Choi Jae Jin and this woman named Lee Se Na...

200
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,590
disappeared together. Is this correct?

201
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,960
What does Ms. Lee Se Na have to do with Mr. Choi Jae Jin?

202
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,230
She's a witch.

203
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,029
She's said to be a witch.

204
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,870
She's his mistress.

205
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,220
Hello? Okay. Got it.

206
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,590
We found the inn where they stayed.

207
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,659
Dear Lord.

208
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Where is it? I don't think this one is it.

209
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,120
Come this way.

210
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,070
Hello.

211
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:47,809
So what happened?

212
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,940
It's been quite a while since they stepped out.

213
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,440
They paid a month's worth of room charges.

214
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,250
In cash, at that.

215
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,620
They were having an affair, weren't they?

216
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,189
I found it strange.

217
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,490
They didn't seem like a married couple at all.

218
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,658
- Hey. - What?

219
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,659
- You better see this. - What is it?

220
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:09,860
- What? - What is it?

221
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:15,070
Isn't this a written will?

222
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,179
Dear my beloved family.

223
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,850
All those happy moments in my life...

224
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,450
flash before my eyes.

225
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,049
But my life was more of painful suffering...

226
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,289
than happiness.

227
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,559
So I, Choi Jae Jin,

228
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,860
am going to end my life here.

229
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,309
Mother.

230
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,110
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

231
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,779
Please forgive your ungrateful son.

232
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,529
- Gosh. - Ma'am.

233
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:20,759
Goodness. What is...

234
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,429
- Let's go outside. - Let's escort her out.

235
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,700
Come on, ma'am.

236
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,970
Madam.

237
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,980
Yeong Won.

238
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:35,049
Thank you, and I love you.

239
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,750
I'm sorry I have to make this choice.

240
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:47,120
And my son...

241
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,029
My dear Do Hyun.

242
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,769
(83H 2949)

243
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,700
I hope...

244
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,210
you'll understand me one day.

245
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,639
Once again,

246
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,110
I'm deeply sorry...

247
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,778
to all my family, and I send them my love.

248
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:13,779
(I send them my love.)

249
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,159
Jae Jin... Jae Jin, my son.

250
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,190
Jump. There you go. Use your knees.

251
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
Jump.

252
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:33,059
Let go now.

253
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,230
Yes!

254
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,370
This is exciting!

255
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,660
Let us keep the written will.

256
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,450
It seems he killed himself, right?

257
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,319
I guess so.

258
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:30,880
Mother.

259
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,819
Mother, let's go.

260
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:47,900
Mother.

261
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,480
Pull yourself together.

262
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,420
You're satisfied, aren't you?

263
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,589
Are you satisfied with what happened to Jae Jin?

264
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,960
I kept telling you it was dangerous.

265
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,960
I kept urging you...

266
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:23,200
that we should report him missing.

267
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,839
If something did...

268
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,779
happen to Jae Jin,

269
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:37,380
I'm never going to forgive you, Ms. No.

270
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,480
We've been inquiring around and investigating the case,

271
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:14,819
but given the circumstances...

272
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,619
No. It can't be true.

273
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,629
(Korea Coast Guard)

274
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,690
Why would Jae Jin...

275
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,400
Yeong Won. What happened?

276
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,730
Why would Jae Jin kill himself?

277
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,200
What about the written will? Are you sure he wrote it?

278
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,469
We're analysing his handwriting at the moment.

279
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,140
But we can't track any living signs such as his phone and credit cards.

280
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,750
Seeing that his will was found,

281
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,450
- it must be suicide... - No.

282
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,420
No. That is impossible.

283
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,319
She's right. That's impossible.

284
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,519
Besides, his body wasn't found.

285
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,088
You shouldn't conclude it so easily like that.

286
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,199
From our perspective, we've found his will.

287
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,068
Even after writing a will,

288
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:03,869
he might have changed his mind.

289
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,139
Never. He's alive for sure!

290
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,170
See? She says he's alive too!

291
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:14,140
What about the CCTVs?

292
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,579
He must be caught somewhere.

293
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,919
Since Friday he entered the island,

294
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,890
these are his locations we've found so far.

295
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,518
He was caught on the CCTV...

296
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:27,118
near the jjamppong restaurant on Friday.

297
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,189
Near the jjamppong restaurant?

298
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,798
Are you saying he came all the way here for jjamppong?

299
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,599
We've already confirmed it.

300
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,769
- Yes? - Yes.

301
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,170
Keep playing.

302
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,268
(December 8, 2023)

303
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:42,339
The market?

304
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:43,970
What did he buy there?

305
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,180
We confirmed that he bought those two bags.

306
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,980
That big bag was found in his car.

307
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,349
It seems the small bag is lost.

308
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,389
Then on Saturday night,

309
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,920
he appeared in front of the port next.

310
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:00,690
What about the CCTV in the port?

311
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,828
We don't have CCTV cameras there.

312
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:05,630
You think that makes sense?

313
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,299
There's no CCTV in the port?

314
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,970
That's what I mean!

315
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,298
Are you trying to turn this place into a suicide attraction?

316
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,209
This is a problem!

317
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,778
Young Min, stay out of this.

318
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:21,109
How can I stay out of this?

319
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:24,309
You're strange for being calm in a situation like this!

320
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,519
So, after that, there's no sign...

321
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,589
of the two leaving the port.

322
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,659
They were not caught in any other CCTVs...

323
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,329
No. That is never possible!

324
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,789
She's right.

325
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,099
He has no reason to commit suicide.

326
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,068
I know it's absurd that Jae Jin cheated.

327
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:46,939
And he must've been scared...

328
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,170
that he got caught.

329
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:51,609
But it's strange that he'd commit suicide for that.

330
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:54,079
Seriously. This is frustrating.

331
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,880
Yes. That woman. What about Lee Se Na?

332
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,649
He said she was a witch.

333
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,450
She said she'd kill us all!

334
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,490
Then she...

335
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,719
killed Jae Jin...

336
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,089
No. That can't be true.

337
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,528
Oh, no.

338
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:12,859
This isn't suicide. This could be a murder case.

339
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,828
- You need to calm down. - Take him outside.

340
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:16,568
- Wait. Why... - You need to leave.

341
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,098
Why are you kicking me out?

342
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,539
I hear you.

343
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,069
Oh, Jae Jin.

344
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,139
No...

345
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,910
Poor guy.

346
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,309
What did he not have? Wealth? Family?

347
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,049
Fame?

348
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,190
How did he end up involved with...

349
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,489
such a crazy weirdo?

350
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,490
- Jae Jin. - Stop it. Cut it out!

351
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,930
Gosh.

(Korea Coast Guard)

354
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,420
What should we do now?

355
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,490
They told us to wait.

356
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,200
We'll head home for now.

357
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,230
Do Hyun is waiting for us.

358
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,670
There's no more ferry for tonight.

359
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,740
Should I look for an alternative?

360
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,039
Yes. I'd appreciate it if you could.

361
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,980
Going home?

362
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,650
Leaving Jae Jin here?

363
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,089
Are you expecting me to stay here?

364
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:44,619
Cold.

365
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,289
So cold.

366
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,960
Jae Jin...

367
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,960
could be in this sea.

368
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:56,900
All we can do is wait.

369
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,440
And to be honest,

370
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,269
it's not like his corpse was found.

371
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:08,349
Are you saying you're waiting for his corpse to be found?

372
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,849
Are you saying that's all we can do?

373
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,119
How can you be so cold?

374
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,289
No wonder Dr. Choi was lonely enough to...

375
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,630
Mother!

376
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,329
Honestly, my husband who cheated on me...

377
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:28,269
might have committed suicide with that woman.

378
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,900
How can you expect me to be sad and pity him?

379
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,970
What's the big deal about cheating?

380
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,508
A man might be dead.

381
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:39,380
So considering what happened,

382
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,849
at least I must remain calm.

383
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,750
I'm going to look after my son...

384
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,150
even if Jae Jin is dead.

385
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,890
Ms. No, watch your mouth.

386
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:01,430
Jae Jin isn't dead.

387
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,200
He's alive and breathing here somewhere.

388
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,249
Do you sense it?

389
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,009
Are you a psychic or something?

390
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,349
Why are you looking at me like that?

391
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:26,390
Then are you going to stay here?

392
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,960
I'm going to find my son.

(Korea Coast Guard)

394
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,170
(Korea Coast Guard)

395
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,319
Hello?

396
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:01,960
Where's Do Hyun?

397
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:04,259
Oh, hello. This is me, Tae Oh.

398
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,028
I have his phone because...

399
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:08,970
he was getting too many messages while I was teaching him.

400
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:12,400
So I told him to work on questions and brought his phone downstairs.

401
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:14,099
Can you put Do Hyun on the phone?

402
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,839
- Yeong Won. - Yes.

403
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,740
Never mind.

404
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,140
Tell him I'll be home late...

405
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,049
and that I'll call him back.

406
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,150
Yes. Bye.

407
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,730
Ma'am.

408
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:44,028
Can you give me a glass of tea?

409
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,039
Okay.

410
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,289
Now that I think about it,

411
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,599
I had a really tough time back then.

412
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,268
Mom was hospitalized,

413
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:17,970
and you got married.

414
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,970
It felt like I was left alone.

415
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,509
Yet, I carried on with my best.

416
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,339
You didn't know, did you?

417
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,809
I was disappointed when you said you were getting married.

418
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,018
You worked so hard...

419
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,779
to win their favour.

420
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,420
Look what happened to you now.

421
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,289
By the way, what on earth did you do that Jae Jin...

422
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:45,859
What did I do?

423
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,900
Is it my fault that he committed suicide?

424
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,499
He was a coward for making others feel guilty...

425
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,200
by making that decision.

426
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,170
How can you be so cold-hearted?

427
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,240
You don't know that, do you?

428
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,268
You always have to be right.

429
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,710
Everyone must follow your order. You have to get everything your way.

430
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,250
Have you ever thought maybe you suffocated Jae Jin?

431
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:07,249
Even if you're right,

432
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,650
people just want you to...

433
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:11,789
listen to them.

434
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,960
Did Jae Jin say I suffocated him?

435
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,960
Is that why he had an affair with another woman for a year?

436
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,329
Are you expecting me to understand that?

437
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,240
I don't even know what's going on anymore.

438
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,009
I can't even tell what's real and what's fake.

439
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,880
I can't even tell...

440
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,950
if this is the family I used to know.

441
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,420
Do you know what I went through for this family?

442
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,990
I find myself so pathetic...

443
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,319
for feeling unfair. It's driving me crazy!

444
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,400
He might be dead.

445
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,700
Why on earth did he die?

446
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,200
I hate him for that,

447
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,869
yet I'm scared...

448
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,109
that he might really be dead.

449
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,680
But what can I do?

450
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,390
I'm still Do Hyun's mom.

451
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,890
I must not crumble.

452
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,769
Do Hyun.

453
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,240
- Mom? - Yes. Get up.

454
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:44,670
Let's have breakfast.

455
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,079
- Get washed up and come down. - Okay.

456
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:57,990
Did you go somewhere far?

457
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:00,920
Yes.

458
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,089
But why isn't Dad's phone on?

459
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,059
He must be very busy.

460
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:14,339
Who are you messaging so intently this early in the morning, son?

461
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,069
A friend.

462
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:17,970
Which friend?

463
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,839
Do you have to know all that?

464
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:33,819
So Yi.

465
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,460
You're here early.

466
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,170
What are you doing? Let's go inside.

467
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,680
I heard we would all die.

468
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,278
After arriving on the island, Choi's car was found in the sea,

469
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,419
but the whereabouts of the two people are still unknown.

470
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,419
However, at the bed and breakfast where they stayed,

471
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,189
Choi's suicide note was found.

472
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,328
The Korea Coast Guard is suspecting this as a joint suicide...

473
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:43,690
and are searching for the bodies.

474
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:47,528
However, the bodies have not been found near the car's location.

475
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:50,429
The Korea Coast Guard has expanded the search perimeter 20km...

476
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,169
to the east and west and 30km to the north and south...

477
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,700
underwater with the efforts of search divers.

478
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,440
What about Jae Jin?

479
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,808
Where is Jae Jin?

480
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:01,910
He disappeared.

481
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,779
With...

482
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,650
that woman?

483
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,789
The two could've died together.

484
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,059
They found a suicide note.

485
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,460
No way.

486
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:18,800
You're right. It makes no sense.

487
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,300
So, I must know exactly.

488
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,070
What happened on the day...

489
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,670
you came to the vacation home?

490
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,809
That is...

491
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,610
That day, Director Choi...

492
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,408
left work early...

493
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,179
- unlike usual. - Yes?

494
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:45,489
I'm leaving work now. Great work today.

495
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,929
Is that right? Okay, got it.

496
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,539
Something felt weird. So...

497
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,150
I went after him.

498
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,739
They will all die.

499
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:13,139
She said they would die.

500
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,809
That everyone will die.

501
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,480
Did that woman really...

502
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,949
Jae Jin...

503
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,190
No way.

504
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,820
If Jae Jin really committed suicide,

505
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:30,690
why do you think he chose to do that?

506
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,630
Didn't you feel anything strange?

507
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,869
Were there any problems at the hospital?

508
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:38,940
I...

509
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:43,070
saw the photos on your phone too.

510
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,110
You and Jae Jin.

511
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,949
You looked like you'd known each other since you were young.

512
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,210
Did you lie to me about that on purpose until now?

513
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,289
Do you know how I feel right now?

514
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,829
From an affair...

515
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,030
to suicide...

516
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:15,239
I'm not sure if this is the Jae Jin I've known until now.

517
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,769
So,

518
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:21,710
I want to know...

519
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,780
why Jae Jin made this choice, at least.

520
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,719
That's because...

521
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,389
you don't know Jae Jin.

522
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,960
What don't I know?

523
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,059
There are such things...

524
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,530
that you can't know about.

525
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,070
You should go now.

526
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:01,920
What will you do?

527
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,960
- You don't see him, do you? - No, we don't.

528
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,789
- Did he already get swept away? - No.

529
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:12,699
It must mean he's alive.

530
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,630
Is there a reason why you're so sure?

531
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,699
My son and I are connected.

532
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:21,699
Shall I call it a strong signal?

533
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,968
Anyway, if he did fall in,

534
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,078
the body would rise to the surface in ten days.

535
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,710
But there's a net in the middle here,

536
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,679
so there's no way that a body wouldn't have gotten caught in it.

537
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,719
I have no idea.

538
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,579
Let's go over there for now.

539
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:37,718
Then, let's call for more backup and head over.

540
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,719
- Let's go. - Got it.

541
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:51,469
I hear he rented this car in Tongyeong on Thursday.

542
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,768
After the car came inside the port on Saturday night,

543
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:57,369
it never left after that.

544
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:01,079
Are you sure there was a person inside the car?

545
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,880
It's hard to tell since it was at night, but the circumstances seem...

546
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:08,349
- That's it. - What?

547
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,150
Agatha Christie.

548
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:12,690
"And Then There Were None."

549
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:16,860
The culprit was Judge Wargrave.

550
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:18,389
That's right.

551
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,429
He also dies in the middle of the story,

552
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,299
but the author never actually wrote...

553
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,469
that he died anywhere in the novel.

554
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,599
He died, but he didn't die.

555
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,869
It's certain that he came in here.

556
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:35,079
We can't be sure that he left from here, though.

557
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,449
But if he really didn't leave?

558
