1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,009
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,009
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,009
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,740
All right, Ms. Lee Se Na.

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,780
I'll ask you again.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,880
You were in a common law marriage with the late Mr. Kang Tae Sik,

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,150
and you were with him at home that night too.

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,260
But didn't you realize that Kang Tae Sik's body had caught fire?

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,329
The crime scene inspection said...

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,829
that he caught fire from the bonfire in the yard.

11
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:30,839
Then, did you have an argument with Mr. Kang that night?

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,979
It was my birthday.

13
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:42,079
Happy birthday to you

14
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,219
Happy birthday to you, Lee Se Na

15
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:53,359
Happy birthday.

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,700
Darn it.

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,019
Your birthday? That was why you fought?

18
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,489
He ate my cake.

19
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,950
What did you say?

20
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:24,890
Can't you hear?

21
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,459
Gosh.

22
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,560
Then, Ms. Lee,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,358
what were you doing until Mr. Kang burned to death...

24
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,469
in the yard?

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,439
I said he ate my cake.

26
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,939
I hadn't even blown out the candle.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,739
So,

28
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,180
did you just watch as Mr. Kang was dying?

29
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,629
Professor, that woman is not in her right mind.

30
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,569
Her husband died, but she's just talking about her birthday.

31
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,669
It's a characteristic of narcissists.

32
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,169
But then, not all of them become murderers.

33
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,309
Let's get her to confess.

34
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,938
(Recording)

35
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,280
My house...

36
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,879
had a huge garden.

37
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,919
My dad had a big business.

38
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,550
Was that why?

39
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:31,520
Mom always threw parties in the garden.

40
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,900
My parents danced the waltz...

41
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,729
to my sister's piano performance.

42
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:43,770
Dad would always miss a step,

43
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,009
so he'd get an earful from Mom.

44
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,039
And what about you?

45
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:50,580
Me?

46
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,250
I draw.

47
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,509
A picture of my sister playing the piano.

48
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,819
Then, what about your parents dancing the waltz?

49
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,990
My dad missed a step.

50
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,889
Then, it'd be a crooked picture.

51
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,090
I see.

52
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,560
That's what happened.

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,560
You must've liked your sister a lot.

54
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,569
My sister was...

55
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,699
pretty.

56
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,900
That's what they always said.

57
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,509
I...

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,810
I also liked...

59
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:28,979
my sister.

60
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,319
So, I tried to protect her.

61
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,090
- Se Eun. - Se Eun.

62
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,430
Why? What's wrong?

63
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,629
- Oh, goodness. - Are you okay?

64
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,830
- It's fine. Oh, dear. - Oh, my.

65
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,979
Did something happen to your sister?

66
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,680
They died. All three of them.

67
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,650
I was the only one left in that big house.

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,090
Had I known, I would've let the cat live.

69
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,699
Did you kill a cat?

70
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,970
It hurt my sister.

71
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,709
Why on earth did you do that?

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,909
- Darn it! - Honey!

73
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,879
But everyone said I had done something wrong.

74
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,720
All I wanted to do was protect my family.

75
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,720
So,

76
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,519
did you want your husbands to die?

77
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,759
Do you think I killed them?

78
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,269
From what I can see, Ms. Lee,

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,699
you seem to have the wrong idea...

80
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,339
about what it means to love someone.

81
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,310
Professor.

82
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,480
You don't know what love is, do you?

83
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,079
I don't think you've been married.

84
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,629
Ms. Lee, I think you should get professional help.

85
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,230
Being overly obsessed with love...

86
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,860
means that you're reliant on something in the wrong way.

87
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,170
Therefore...

88
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,519
(Chapter 6: Is Your Family Well?)

89
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,419
Then,

90
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,619
("No Yeong Won's Everlasting Solution")

91
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,459
the efforts that I made will become meaningless.

92
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,199
Why doesn't my family know how I feel?

93
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,769
Why do they only resent me?

94
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,000
I endured it all for my family.

95
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:07,569
But now, they all blame me...

96
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,509
and want to leave me.

97
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,250
I think that you must get away...

98
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,019
from a family that makes you suffer, not endure it.

99
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,649
But they're family.

100
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,290
In order to protect my family,

101
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,290
I did all sorts of things.

102
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,529
But my family only despised me and wanted to leave me.

103
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:34,628
- They said they were my family... - They said they were my family...

104
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,629
but they ended their love first.

105
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:43,470
Have you ever thought about why they tried to leave you?

106
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,250
Ms. Lee, you say that you did those things to protect your family,

107
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,879
but haven't you thought...

108
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,420
that you actually made your family suffer?

109
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,589
Are you saying that I was wrong?

110
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,290
You shouldn't criticize me...

111
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,259
for trying to protect my family.

112
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,029
A perfect family shouldn't do that.

113
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,100
What is a perfect family?

114
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:11,638
It would be a relationship that is strongly connected...

115
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,870
by a thread called love.

116
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:18,279
But if that thread is rotting from pain,

117
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,310
shouldn't you cut it out?

118
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,720
Your actions to protect your family...

119
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:31,889
have failed.

120
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:36,959
You did so in the wrong way.

121
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,839
- What makes you... - So confident?

122
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,579
What kind of family do you live with that makes you act like that?

123
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,829
Yes, come in.

124
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,829
Hello. Welcome.

125
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,139
It doesn't hurt, does it?

126
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,180
No.

127
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,980
Okay, just a moment.

128
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,050
Thank you.

129
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,289
Now, you're done with your burn treatment.

130
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,059
You've been through a lot over a long period.

131
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,830
It's not an easy thing to get surgery from you personally.

132
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,129
Still, I think it was a good idea for me to wait...

133
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,600
and get surgery from you.

134
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,799
Well, you don't have any other side effects, do you?

135
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,769
I do.

136
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,250
You can treat that too, can't you?

137
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,450
Is something wrong? What are your symptoms?

138
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,090
I want to buy you dinner to show you my gratitude.

139
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,899
I don't have to wait a few months to have dinner with you, do I?

140
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,200
Oh, well...

141
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:27,200
So...

142
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,879
I'll have the course meal.

143
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,649
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,080
I'll have the same.

145
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,980
What's the dessert for today?

146
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,590
It's a fondant au chocolat that was baked with ganache inside.

147
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,659
I see. Then,

148
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,960
I'd like to have the dessert first.

149
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,629
Yes, let's do that. Please give us that first.

150
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,730
Okay, then I'll serve you the dessert first.

151
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,399
Do you eat your dessert first?

152
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,639
Who knows what might happen in the future?

153
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:05,809
It will be a shame to die before I get to eat such a tasty dish.

154
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,309
Why think about dying and how much of a shame it would be already?

155
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,350
If one's whole family dies,

156
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,250
one must become that way.

157
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,659
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

158
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,559
It's okay.

159
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,360
It was a very long time ago.

160
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,970
When my dad went on a business trip to Paris,

161
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,100
our whole family went along too.

162
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,840
That day, we were planning on going up to the Eiffel Tower...

163
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,808
and eating dinner at the restaurant right in front of it.

164
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:38,980
That was our plan.

165
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:40,879
But then,

166
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:45,649
I loved the hotel so much that I didn't want to go out.

167
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,019
So without me,

168
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,789
my parents...

169
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,330
and my older sister went downtown as planned.

170
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,769
It was a car accident.

171
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,440
And the car was burned to ashes.

172
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,820
I had a burn scar, you know.

173
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,820
I did that to myself.

174
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,659
I kind of felt guilty that I was alive alone.

175
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,669
I felt like I needed to be burned too.

176
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,269
Your scar's all gone now.

177
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,700
Don't blame yourself too much.

178
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,240
Director Choi.

179
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,350
Should I tell you something fascinating?

180
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,049
What is it?

181
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,179
Now that my scar is gone for real,

182
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,490
I feel...

183
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,360
somewhat at ease.

184
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,600
You're my savior.

185
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,440
(742-3 Seojeong-myeon)

186
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,320
My mother was a novelist.

187
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,789
Once, she was famous for her mystery novels.

188
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,659
And this used to be her writing place.

189
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,789
She stopped writing when I grew up.

190
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,000
It was probably because of me.

191
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,969
My father troubled her...

192
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,740
with too many affairs.

193
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,309
So they were on bad terms.

194
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,139
I guess it was from then on.

195
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,649
It seemed as if she had made up her mind to dedicate her life to me.

196
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,950
It made it so hard for me to go against her.

197
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,120
That's why you went to med school...

198
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,090
even when you're terrified to see blood.

199
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,100
Oh, that? My mother was aware of it.

200
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,070
Still, she didn't give up making her son a doctor.

201
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:20,370
And that's why she had Ms. Oh Ji Eun become a doctor?

202
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,940
Yes.

203
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,940
Does Ms. No...

204
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,049
still not know about these secrets?

205
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,220
I've imagined what it'd be like if I told her.

206
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,490
She probably wouldn't be able to understand me.

207
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,000
Never.

208
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:49,129
She'd just want me to remain an ordinary doctor husband...

209
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,899
regardless of my will.

210
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,210
Just like how my mom made me into who she wanted me to be.

211
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,378
Then, what did you want to become?

212
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,379
Me?

213
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:04,850
What...

214
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,789
did I want to become?

215
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,830
I don't even remember.

216
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:21,330
It's all right.

217
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,899
You can start dreaming again.

218
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:37,509
What is it that you want, Se Na?

219
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,589
I wanted to escape from the painful memories...

220
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,960
of my family.

221
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,730
But you have already redeemed me.

222
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,070
That's more than enough.

223
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,200
I want to be really good to you.

224
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,009
I know.

225
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,590
Then, make me happier.

226
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,038
(No Yeong Won, Choi Do Hyun)

227
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,109
(Choi Jae Jin)

228
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,480
(Choi Go Myeon, Hong Sa Kang)

229
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,320
(Is your family well?)

230
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:38,970
It's good to see you.

231
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,210
I really wanted to see you.

232
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,778
They know nothing about each other,

233
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:49,580
but they act like they do just because they're family.

234
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,480
What about you?

235
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,949
What do you mean?

236
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,149
Do you know everything...

237
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,220
about your family?

238
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,590
Well,

239
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,029
a family doesn't always mean they know all about each other.

240
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,559
I see.

241
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,500
(Wife: Jung Sun Hee, Children: Yeong Won, Young Min)

242
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,769
Do you still feel wronged?

243
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,279
There was nothing I could do.

244
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,379
Still as I promised,

245
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,950
I took Yeong Won in.

246
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,279
She's doing great.

247
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,390
So you should...

248
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,099
You don't have to know everything?

249
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:46,569
Would you think the same if you found out they deceived you?

250
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:53,809
Why did you die?

251
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,809
You're a total spoiler.

252
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,279
To my husband,

253
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,920
who did so much to support me from my side,

254
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:06,359
Ms. Hong Sa Kang,

255
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,829
and to Father, who cherished me like a daughter,

256
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,359
I would like to dedicate this honor.

257
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,970
You'll even let your father's death slide?

258
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,039
That's amusing.

259
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,980
(1 Unread Message)

260
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,950
No Yeong Won left after receiving the vacation home's miniature.

261
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,618
- Se Na. - You came.

262
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,619
Hi.

263
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,259
- Did you wait long? - No.

264
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,859
I bought this on my way here.

265
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,059
You like yellow.

266
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:50,470
Happy one-year anniversary.

267
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,940
Thanks.

268
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,240
It's a white wine.

269
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,439
I wanted to come sooner,

270
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,739
but Nurse Park kept taking more patients.

271
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,308
I told her to stop, but she kept taking patients.

272
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,179
And the VIP client paid a visit this time.

273
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,548
We couldn't just tell her to leave.

274
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:08,890
It's okay. Go get changed already.

275
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,049
Okay.

276
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:53,259
You weren't part of the plan.

277
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,250
They will all die.

278
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,960
Se Na.

279
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,599
Are you hurt?

280
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,230
Ji Eun?

281
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:34,299
Ji Eun!

282
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Blood...

283
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,279
She's bleeding.

284
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:41,549
She tried to kill me.

285
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,609
Ji Eun?

286
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,789
I told you that Oh Ji Eun was stalking you.

287
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,720
That must be why she tried to kill me.

288
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:58,160
I see.

289
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:01,299
You must be startled. I'm sorry.

290
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,940
I'll talk her into it when she wakes up.

291
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:07,500
I better take her to the hospital first.

292
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
(Calls)

293
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,019
(Madam Hong)

294
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,500
I told you.

295
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,569
Oh Ji Eun lived...

296
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,670
for Madam Hong not you.

297
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,670
You know what she's like.

298
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,740
Now that she's been notified, she'll come here.

299
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,009
What do we do then?

300
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,980
We must leave.

301
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,920
Before Madam Hong gets here.

302
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,289
What about Ji Eun?

303
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,839
You're nervous, aren't you?

304
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:49,868
Se Na, if my mom found out...

305
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,309
Yes, I understand.

306
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,809
Do you just want to leave somewhere far?

307
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,480
Do you...

308
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,019
want to go back?

309
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:07,519
Then you'll have to live behind a mask.

310
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,690
That's so sad.

311
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,200
I can't just stand to watch it.

312
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,969
- Se Na... - Your family...

313
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,170
won't change with you.

314
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,740
But you know I can't live without you.

315
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,079
You wanted to be free, didn't you?

316
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:32,519
But...

317
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:36,250
They're going to find me no matter what.

318
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,160
What if they can't?

319
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,460
This time,

320
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,160
I will save you.

321
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:05,920
Now...

322
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:08,920
no one can find us.

323
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,490
No one.

324
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,960
Se Na.

325
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:25,170
I feel like I can be really happy now.

326
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:39,778
I think you've all come because of the recent rumors.

327
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,319
That incident is unrelated to us.

328
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,619
Are you saying the Choi...

329
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:51,059
Jae Jin.

330
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:00,069
Hand.

331
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:18,390
What are you doing?

332
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:20,559
How does it feel to be born again?

333
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,930
What?

334
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:24,160
You just died.

335
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,960
And you're reborn.

336
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,230
So now,

337
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,339
it's time for a new life.

338
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,450
A new life?

339
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,880
What do you mean?

340
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,689
Are you saying you don't care even if Jae Jin dies?

341
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,720
No.

342
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,990
I don't care even if he dies.

343
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,690
He is now a dead person in my life.

344
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:59,099
Would you do this even if this happened to Do Hyun?

345
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,729
Would you still act like this even if he's with a dangerous woman?

346
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,730
Yes.

347
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:06,700
So I'm going to take care of my son from now on.

348
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,739
This whole situation. His dad's hideous lies.

349
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,680
How am I going to explain them to Do Hyun?

350
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,578
That's what worries me more.

351
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:16,509
How can you do that to your family? Is that really necessary?

352
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,650
Family?

353
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,849
A husband who deceived me with those lies?

354
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:23,220
Do you call that a family?

355
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:26,389
Then? What are you going to do? Get a divorce?

356
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,559
No, why would I?

357
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:30,759
I can't let him go so easily.

358
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,799
When he returns,

359
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,170
everything that I went through because of him.

360
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,470
I'll make him pay for that.

361
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,640
Ms. No!

362
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:45,509
I'll make sure your son...

363
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:49,279
won't be disregarded by his own son.

364
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,180
So stop telling me to worry about Jae Jin.

365
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,829
Son.

366
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,099
So, is Dad okay?

367
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:15,809
Yes.

368
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,740
Where is he then?

369
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:20,140
I'll be honest with you.

370
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,650
Dad...

371
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,779
won't answer his phone.

372
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,849
I guess he wants to be away for the moment.

373
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,390
Then the Tongyeong incident on the news.

374
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,819
Is that about Dad?

375
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:36,359
Yes, it is.

376
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,259
But...

377
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,230
So he's having an affair?

378
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:42,900
That's also true.

379
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:51,880
Are you divorcing him?

380
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,960
I'll follow your decision.

381
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,990
As long as you're okay.

382
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,099
You're closer to Dad.

383
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,630
Dad will be disappointed when he hears this.

384
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,700
It occurred to me...

385
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,140
my way...

386
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,380
must've suffocated Dad.

387
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,250
You too felt suffocated because of your tight schedule.

388
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,250
Still, I don't find your way uncomfortable.

389
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,660
I know how much effort you put in for us.

390
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:44,960
Besides, Dad's at fault for this.

391
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:50,400
I appreciate it.

392
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,970
You're all grown up now.

393
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,339
Are you okay, Mom?

394
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
Yes.

395
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,349
I want you to be honest with your feelings.

396
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,190
Say you're angry when you're angry. Say you're upset when you're upset.

397
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,190
You're right.

398
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,430
After this incident,

399
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:18,900
I came to think...

400
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,400
what if Dad was...

401
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,339
a bit more honest with me?

402
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,670
I hope you are...

403
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,279
honest with me.

404
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,480
Let's go.

405
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,220
Do Hyun?

406
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,619
Do Hyun. Let's get up.

407
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:19,518
Come on. Oh, you're so tired.

408
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,319
- Already? - Wash up and come down.

409
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Gosh.

410
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,399
I bought a cod because it's in season. How is it?

411
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,469
Yes, it's good.

412
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,339
Because it's in season, it's plump.

413
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,509
Dr. Choi used to love spicy fish...

414
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,440
- Good. I like it. - Yes.

415
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,250
Good morning, Mother.

416
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,250
Ma'am, get me a new pillow.

417
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,819
I can't sleep at all.

418
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,990
Yes, ma'am.

419
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,759
Were you not able to sleep?

420
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,288
Then would you like some warm tea?

421
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,960
The guava leaf tea is the best for your immune system.

422
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:00,700
What are you pulling here?

423
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,399
What do you mean?

424
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,899
You're making fun of me straight up.

425
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,839
Do you think I'm in the mood to drink the guava leaf tea?

426
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,868
What's wrong? I'm only back to my ordinary life.

427
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,338
How can this be your ordinary life?

428
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,509
Dr. Choi is missing. How?

429
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,710
As long as he didn't jump into the water.

430
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,890
Do you want a cold salad?

431
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,619
With your favorite cucumbers and mung bean sprouts.

432
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,358
- So cold. - That's why it's a cold salad.

433
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,160
You love cold salads.

434
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,769
I don't.

435
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:38,069
I hate everything cold.

436
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,740
She's so sensitive.

437
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,539
Is it because she couldn't sleep?

438
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,249
"No Yeong Won's Everlasting Solution."

439
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,989
Here to give us refreshing solutions,

440
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,489
Dr. No Yeong Won is here with us today as well.

441
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,230
- Hello, Dr. No. - Hello, I'm No Yeong Won.

442
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,430
Has your family been well this week too?

443
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:08,528
Yes, Dr. No. Actually, it's not easy...

444
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:11,769
to talk about your family with other people.

445
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,699
And it can be a bit overwhelming...

446
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,508
to think that others know about my family.

447
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:17,569
Of course.

448
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:22,578
As you know, stories about my family...

449
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:25,180
have been a subject of discussion among the public too.

450
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,548
So, I know how that feels very well.

451
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:31,719
But all of that turned out to be just happenings of coincidence.

452
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,859
Yes, that's right.

453
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,389
But still, I think there are people...

454
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,159
who doubt my family.

455
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,258
And of course, I consider that to be...

456
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:43,269
your concern and attention as well.

457
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:45,670
But...

458
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:50,240
I believe that the form of love in each family is different.

459
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,410
It is a very frightening thing for one's family history to be revealed.

460
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,549
Despite that fear,

461
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,920
people work up the courage...

462
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,318
to send us their stories in order to protect their families.

463
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,490
Please do not speak...

464
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,730
so easily about their stories.

465
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,299
Disguising a suicide...

466
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,400
doesn't mean someone planned to murder.

467
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,380
Then, why Jae Jin?

468
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,049
Yes, Madam.

469
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:41,190
"Here, I have..."

470
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:44,559
"a colorless spool of thread called life."

471
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,829
"Inside this spool,"

472
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,670
"there is an orange thread called murder."

473
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:53,099
"Untangling this thread..."

474
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:56,539
"and revealing it to the whole world..."

475
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,109
"is what we detectives must do."

476
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,240
"Sherlock Holmes."

477
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,250
Mr. Park.

478
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:09,219
In order to find out why Lee Se Na is doing this, we need clues.

479
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,059
Where are her belongings that you brought from the vacation home?

480
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:19,198
Inside that spool of thread, there will be the orange thread...

481
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,260
that could be a clue.

482
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,400
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,519
("And I Was Left Alone")

484
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,170
Have you found a clue?

485
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,199
- Mr. Park. - Yes?

486
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:02,469
I was the one Lee Se Na was after.

487
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,039
What? You, Madam?

488
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,010
Psychopaths who become madly obsessed with mystery novels...

489
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,049
sometimes act like the characters in the novels...

490
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,179
written by their favorite writers.

491
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,618
Hang on.

492
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:22,230
(Soft Hands)

493
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,429
Look at this.

494
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:30,629
This is...

495
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,039
the forum where I've been posting my Internet novel these days.

496
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,440
Here. This.

497
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,039
I'm sure this is a forewarning that Lee Se Na sent me.

498
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,349
I was wondering who had sent me such a malicious comment.

499
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:51,349
Why didn't you mention it back then?

500
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,719
Because it was a secret that I was Cigarette Queen.

501
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,400
Actually, I was aware.

502
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,069
Then, perhaps...

503
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,940
(She's not that kind of person.)

504
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:10,909
Sandglass?

505
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Yes, ma'am.

506
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:24,420
Gosh, it's cold.

507
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,219
Madam.

508
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,530
See? I was right, wasn't I?

509
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:33,029
I told you Jae Jin didn't commit suicide.

510
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,429
Then, why did he write a written will?

511
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,369
It doesn't make any sense.

512
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,139
- They're all lies. - You're right.

513
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:44,110
Then, that means my sister also knew that they were all lies too.

514
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,809
Madam, is my sister all right? Hasn't she gone insane?

515
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:50,880
She seemed absolutely fine.

516
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,619
Figures. My sister does have great mental strength.

517
00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:00,589
But it wasn't enough that Jae Jin had an affair...

518
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,159
but he also disguised it as suicide.

519
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:06,159
That guy is the one who has gone insane.

520
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,969
You speak rather harshly.

521
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,599
My Jae Jin hasn't gone insane.

522
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,169
He was being controlled by Lee Se Na.

523
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,709
How many times must I say this?

524
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,638
It's not like Jae Jin is a little kid or something.

525
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,238
What do you mean, he was being controlled?

526
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,549
It's all because he wanted to do that.

527
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,510
Hey, Young Min. About your brother-in-law...

528
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:28,380
Didn't you say he was being controlled by your sister too?

529
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,889
Hey, you...

530
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,960
Why are you so light-lipped?

531
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,989
Gosh.

532
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,230
What did I do?

533
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,630
Young Min.

534
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,070
You shouldn't speak so rashly when you don't even know that well.

535
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:52,038
This is all because my Jae Jin is too nice...

536
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,210
Gosh, you can't say that he's nice.

537
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,750
He lied so much, you know? It's not making sense.

538
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:59,018
After everything my sister did,

539
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,650
how could he stab her in the back like this?

540
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,460
What on earth am I hearing?

541
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,789
I mean, who was it that took in Ms. No and her family?

542
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,429
What? "It's not making much sense?"

543
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:15,969
You people are the ones who aren't making much sense.

544
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,400
"Took in?"

545
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:20,300
Madam, you're the one who's speaking harshly.

546
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,468
Who was it that took away my sister who had her own family...

547
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,539
and made her grow distant from us?

548
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:26,678
Honestly, has my sister...

549
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,980
done anything else besides work hard for your family?

550
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,078
Isn't it your family who are forgetting about everything...

551
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,480
you should feel grateful to my sister for?

552
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:37,889
Uncle.

553
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,690
Why?

554
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:53,170
- Dr. No. - Yes?

555
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,699
Someone left this in the mailbox.

556
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,409
Why don't you open it now just in case?

557

("The Mousetrap Has Gone Missing")

"Could it be a weed or not?"

560
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:31,070
"If you cannot snip it away as a seedling,"

561
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,178
"you must keep it close and keep watching to see if it becomes..."

562
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:35,210
"a weed or a new leaf."

563
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,849
"The more suspicious you feel, the closer you should keep it."

564
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,960
(A downright lie)

565
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:00,239
What if they're telling me each person's lies in order?

566

(Jjamppong, pork gukbap)

567

("The Mousetrap Has Gone Missing")

568
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,219
What about you?

569
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:24,289
Do you know everything...

570
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,360
about your family?

571
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,329
You said this last time.

572
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,440
Just because they're family doesn't mean they have to know everything.

573
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,039
Are humans such beings...

574
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,549
who can truly forgive...

575
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,880
and understand each other...

576
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:45,980
in the name of family?

577
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,388
All right. Come at me.

578
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:58,960
("Beast's Yesterday")

579
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,760
Mother, I have something to tell you.

580
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,070
Yes, come on in. I have something to tell you too.

581
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,999
I don't think Lee Se Na is just an affair.

582
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,369
You only found that out now.

583
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,840
Ms. No.

584
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,150
Do you know what Lee Se Na is really after?

585
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:18,980
You don't know, do you?

586
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:22,690
That was me.

587
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,150
All of a sudden?

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,328
("And I Was Left Alone")

589
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:33,400
It's my novel that Lee Se Na had been reading at the vacation home.

590
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,730
I didn't realize it back then,

591
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,570
but this was a clue.

592
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,599
At this rate, isn't it certain that she's targeting me?

593
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:46,579
This is a photo that came with the headless pigeon last time.

594
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,449
- In this photo... - There are numbers?

595
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,050
You know.

596
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:05,460
The story of a woman who tries to take over a family.

597
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,500
The dead body of that pigeon that you received before.

598
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,099
And these numbers.

599
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:14,300
Everything is the same as it is in this novel.

600
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:18,170
You're right. It's not a simple affair.

601
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,210
I'm sure this means that she intends to do something to my family.

602
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:26,178
She is letting me know of certain lies one by one...

603
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:28,219
in the order that is written here.

605
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,420
I wrote this book too.

Somebody left it in the postbox.

607
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:37,829
If I'm right about her pattern,

608
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,900
number three should be the next clue and that's you.

609
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:45,969
Are you still hiding anything from me?

610
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:47,968
Ms. No.

611
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:51,269
If others hear you, they might think I'm a liar.

612
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:54,079
Actually, I don't care about your lies anymore.

613
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:57,309
I need to know why she's doing this...

614
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,750
and number four is Do Hyun.

615
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,689
If she messes with my son too...

616
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,690
Okay.

617
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:07,460
I'll find Lee Se Na.

618
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,130
You should protect Do Hyun.

619
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,099
Let's focus on each of our sons.

Hi, Do Hyun. You must be tired.

632
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,840
Hi, Mom.

633
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,550
How was class today?

634
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:15,849
We went over the mock CSAT.

635
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,219
I'm a little tired.

636
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,889
It was the same as always.

637
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,730
I'm especially tired this week.

638
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,500
Would it be less tiring...

to take private lessons at home?

640
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,900
I'm not sure.

641
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,170
Studying is tiring in and of itself.

642
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,309
Oh, right. What do you think of Mr. Moon?

643
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:42,380
- Mr. Tae Oh? - Yes.

He says his goal is to become a great psychiatrist like you.

I see.

646
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:52,219
I didn't know that.

647

No.

Oh, right.

Was it So Yi you had a crush on?

651
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,110
What is she like?

652
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:13,739
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

653
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:17,249
You have a crush on her.

654
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,949
Of course, I'm curious.

655
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,190
Are you going out with her?

656
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,030

Why don't we invite her over to our house sometime?

00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:28,579
and sad.

669
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:44,929
This is a senior doctor's son.

670
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,570
He just got accepted to medical school.

671
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:48,500
He's going to go to the same school as you.

672
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,110
Hello. I'm Moon Tae Oh.

673
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,610
Did you say he's your high school friend's son?

674
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,909
How come I don't know that friend?

675
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:57,679
That's strange.

676
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,219
You know every single thing about me.

677
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:06,149
(Korea National University)

678
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,460
- Hi, Yeong Won. - Hey.

679
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,829
Moon Tae Oh really is a med student here.

680
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,159
He has good grades.

681
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,130
He voluntarily works hard at a counseling center.

682
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,230
He's got such a good reputation.

683
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,039
- Really? - Who is Moon Tae Oh?

684
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,469
Do Hyun's tutor.

685
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,868
Do moms in Gangnam...

686
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:27,539
do a background check on their sons' tutors?

687
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,909
Goodness.

688
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,320
Anyway, what do you think is suspicious about him?

689
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,619
Did his student record say anything about his family?

690
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,349
I didn't have access to it.

691
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,519
How did you find this tutor?

692
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:43,389
Jae Jin said he was his high school senior's son.

693
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:46,530
Oh, I get it.

694
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:50,929
Now you can't believe anything he said.

695
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,369
Figures. Given the current situation,

696
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:56,709
it wouldn't be strange if Moon Tae Oh was...

697
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,809
Jae Jin's son, not his senior's.

698
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,409
Goodness.

699
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:08,649
Why did he have to tell those lies...

700
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,619
when he was going to get caught?

701
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,820
How did he even become a doctor with that brain of his?

702
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:14,460
Good job. Get off now.

703
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:17,460
Yeong Won. You can count on me.

704
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:21,199
When Jae Jin comes back, I'll teach him a big lesson.

705
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:23,869
I'll scold him and beat him to a pulp. Okay?

706
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,969
You won't divorce him, will you?

707
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,369
Why? I shouldn't?

708
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,539
Are you going to?

709
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:33,340
Goodness.

710
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,110
It's going to stir up the country again.

711
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,250
- Get off. - Okay.

712
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,619
Gosh, I'm hungry.

713
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,488
The red brick house.

714
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:47,618
(Soft Hands)

715
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:49,260
I better go to that house first.

716
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:50,829
It's in Seongbuk-dong, right?

717
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,760
I should find her and nip her in the bud.

718
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,469
I'll escort you to Seongbuk-dong.

719
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,400
(Queen of Housekeeping Sun Young)

720
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,109
Who came?

721
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,210
(Doctors No Yeong Won and Choi Jae Jin)

722
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,679
(A couple receives the Doctor of the Year award!)

723
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,250
Madam Hong is on her way here.

724
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,889
Okay. You may go back to work.

725
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,559
Sure.

726
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,429
It looks great on you.

727
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,030
Aren't you...

728
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,869
the man who came to see Director Choi the other day?

729
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,138
You saw me?

730
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:45,469
You were there as if you were trying to show yourself.

731
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,309
Right.

732
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:48,639
Anyway,

733
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,579
what's your relationship with him that you're here at your free will?

734
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,619
I'm Do Hyun's tutor.

735
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,920
Tutor?

736
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,789
Do Hyun isn't even here.

737
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,959
Well, I come earlier from time to time.

738
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,489
They treat me like I'm part of their family.

739
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,329
Well...

740
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:12,569
I just tried it on...

741
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,968
No, I understand.

742
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:16,710
There are so many pretty outfits here.

743
00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:18,670
Then, keep this a secret.

744
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:25,480
Anyway,

745
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,280
the dress you're wearing,

746
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:33,190
this place,

747
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,360
and...

748
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,429
this necklace...

749
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:42,329
go amazingly well with you.

750
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,500
Is it because Jae Jin has told me...

751
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,110
so much about you?

752
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:52,570
It feels like...

753
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,440
I've known you.

754
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:59,010
What did he tell you about me?

755
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,150
That he relies on you very much.

756
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,860
You're someone he trusts a lot.

757
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,199
He can't live without you.

758
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,699
Did he really say that about me?

759
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,480
You're someone...

760
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,880
who might know more about him than his family.

761
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:43,690
Don't you think so?

762
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,299
You've returned early, Madam Hong.

763
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,099
I'll go. Take your time to get changed.

764
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:57,209
Where's Dr. Oh?

765
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,579
She's right... She was right here.

766
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:02,610
Where has she gone?

767
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,880
You're back, Madam Hong.

768
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:09,518
You were here too, Tae Oh.

769
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,289
Yes. Dr. Oh is here too.

770
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:15,719
- You two know each other? - Yes.

771
00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:18,488
I met her in front of Jae Jin's clinic.

772
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,699
She went to the restroom. I think she'll be back soon.

773
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:24,369
Why did she go up to the second floor for the restroom?

774
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,170
I'm sorry.

775
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:28,138
I thought she would feel more comfortable there,

776
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,500
so I told her to go upstairs.

777
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,239
- Sun Young. - Yes?

778
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:34,479
You have to keep an eye on our guests.

779
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,739
I will make sure to do that, Madam Hong.

780
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,610
You're here.

781
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:43,650
Follow me.

782
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,090
Are you feeling okay?

783
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:53,599
Yes.

784
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:58,969
You knew about Jae Jin and Se Na's relationship, right?

785
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,469
Why didn't you tell me about it?

786
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:04,969
Why do I need to tell you everything?

787
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,179
Because you told me everything up until now.

788
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,009
I need to know about Jae Jin to...

789
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,050
You don't have to know everything about him.

790
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,920
I'm quite disappointed, Madam Hong.

791
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:21,319
Even when Dr. No came after I got up,

792
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,119
I kept all of our secrets.

793
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:26,230
Ms. No found out about everything anyway.

794
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,000
I think it's better off that way.

795
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:32,829
I can't keep things hidden from her as a family member.

796
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,440
You said I was a family member too.

797
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:39,269
Right.

798
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,340
Thank you, Ji Eun.

799
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,610
Continue to stay by my side.

800
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,550
Ms. No found out about everything.

801
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,719
I can't keep Jae Jin in charge of the clinic anymore.

802
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,530
I'll leave the clinic in your hands.

803
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,590
Okay.

804
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,429
But, Madam Hong.

805
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,699
Will Dr. No stay still?

806
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,969
You said she found out about all of Jae Jin's lies.

807
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,309
They will probably get divorced, right?

808
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,150
Get divorced?

809
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,718
That will never happen.

810
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:26,959
No. Dr. No will leave Jae Jin.

811
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,118
So from now on, I will stay by his side and...

812
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,190
Stop right there.

813
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,659
Are you trying to take her place?

814
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:38,030
No, Dr. Oh.

815
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:41,070
That doesn't sound right, does it?

816
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:45,139
Why is that not possible?

817
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,510
You.

818
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,638
I helped you out when you were left alone...

819
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:50,710
after your grandfather passed away.

820
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,880
You give me no other choice.

821
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:55,480
Look for a different clinic.

822
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:01,019
You know how much I have sacrificed for Jae Jin.

823
00:57:02,059 --> 00:57:04,129
And now, you're trying to throw me out like this?

824
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,030
Throw you out? Me?

825
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,559
I've never let you in.

826
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,070
And did you just say "sacrifice?"

827
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:13,670
I thought you were the one who wanted all of this.

828
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,199
Without me...

829
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,839
Jae Jin wouldn't have reached that far without my help.

830
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,840
No.

831
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:22,340
There were a lot of people who could've replaced you.

832
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,659
Ms. No. There's somewhere you need to go with me.

833
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,130
These pictures.

834
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,460
What do you think about them?

835
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:23,300
I remember...

836
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:27,599
meeting her through a counseling session.

837
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:31,638
Wasn't Lee Se Na already your patient?

838
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:32,710
She was.

839
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:36,179
But I think...

840
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,849
we go way back before that.

841
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,050
So she's trying to get her revenge on you?

842
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,690
That's quite an obvious cliche.

843
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:51,190
Well, I guess all crimes start with a motive.

844
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,000
Must we report this psycho out of her mind to the police?

845
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,619
There's nothing that can be done after reporting her to the police.

846
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,690
There's no evidence that it was sent by her.

847
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,489
This is bad. Very bad.

848
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,130
Do Hyun can be in danger.

849
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,530
We need to find Lee Se Na as quickly as possible.

850
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,630
You're right.

851
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,969
We must find my Jae Jin.

(Doctor of the Year, 2023 KDA Awards)

853
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,400
Gosh.

854
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,360
What are you doing?

855
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,329
(Bitter Sweet Hell)

856
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:10,260
Look at that. She's a total psychopath.

857
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:14,158
No Yeong Won is a pitiful person too.

858
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:15,459
We need to free her.

859
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,058
I wanted to free you who has known nothing...

860
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:18,698
throughout your whole life.

861
01:03:18,699 --> 01:03:20,328
That is why I'm trying to end things like this.

862
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,368
This all happened because of Lee Se Na.

863
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:25,209
I don't want to keep things hidden from you.

864
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,908
Save this young lamb who has fallen prey to the Evil One.

865
01:03:27,909 --> 01:03:29,578
You promised me.

866
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:31,879
You promised to hate the ones who abandon you.

867
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,078
Get to your senses!

868
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:35,479
You're being gaslighted by Lee Se Na.

869
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,079
It's all over now, Yeong Won.

870
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:39,820
We're not the family you think we are.
