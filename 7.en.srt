(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,009
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,309
To me, family is...

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,710
a lifeline.

6
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,619
It's where the true No Yeong Won exists...

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,820
and the strength that gets me back up.

8
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,519
Without family,

9
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,190
I would not be here today.

10
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:19,719
That is why family is...

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,559
the one thing that I must fight for until the very end.

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,660
Protecting my family so that it doesn't fall apart...

13
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:28,730
is my life...

14
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,240
and the reason for my existence.

15
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:35,509
Even if they are family, if they try to ruin you,

16
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,210
you must cut them off.

17
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,979
What kind of family do you live with that makes you act like that?

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,119
The case that my father was involved in...

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,159
I think he was framed for everything.

20
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,619
You said so yourself.

21
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,960
That you become resilient as you slip and fall.

22
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,158
You've slipped and fallen this far.

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,630
You should become strong now.

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,770
And I think Father played a part in doing so.

25
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,598
I understand. But what's important here...

26
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,540
is not revealing the truth...

27
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,439
but the well-being of our family. Don't you think?

28
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,840
Think about what you need to protect, Ms. No.

29
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:15,048
The choice is up to you.

(Doctor of the Year, 2023 KDA Awards)

31
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,150
You'll even let your father's death slide?

32
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,219
That's amusing.

33
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,219
What about you?

34
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,519
Do you know everything...

35
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,120
about your family?

36
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,129
Are you saying that Jae Jin had an affair or something?

37
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,900
Lee Se Na is Dr. Choi's secret mistress.

38
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,269
That was why they were at the vacation home together?

39
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,468
This is what I found out about Lee Se Na.

40
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:37,700
She's a witch, I tell you.

41
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,840
So all of her husbands have died?

42
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,010
Things might not end here.

43
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,509
Dr. Choi Jae Jin could be in danger too.

44
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,879
He just said my Jae Jin is with the witch.

45
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,280
Aren't you even worried about him?

46
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,519
Listen, Mother.

47
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,518
I feel more anger toward the man...

48
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,989
that has fallen into a woman like her.

49
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,958
So what are you going to do?

50
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,459
I will find him.

51
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,730
Won't it be better for him...

52
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,900
to be killed by me instead of the witch?

53
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,539
Where are we going now?

54
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,840
Did you find him?

55
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,740
I heard a car was found in the sea.

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,378
Gosh, that scared me.

57
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,348
There's no one inside.

58
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:24,879
We found the inn where they stayed.

59
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,120
Dear my beloved family.

60
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,960
I'm deeply sorry to all my family, and I send them my love.

61
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,229
Honestly, my husband who cheated on me...

62
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,800
might have committed suicide with that woman.

63
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,030
How can you expect me to be sad and pity him?

64
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,068
Jae Jin isn't dead.

65
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,669
He's alive and breathing here somewhere.

66
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,710
Se Na.

67
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,509
I think I can become really happy now.

68
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,408
It was all an act?

69
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:57,150
I told you...

70
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,650
Jae Jin isn't dead.

71
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,349
I don't think Lee Se Na is just an affair.

72
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,360
I need to know why she's doing this...

73
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,818
and number four is Do Hyun.

74
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,789
If she messes with my son too...

75
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,830
I'll find Lee Se Na.

76
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,300
What are you doing?

77
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,099
You just died.

78
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,770
And you're reborn.

79
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,039
So now,

80
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,080
it's time for a new life.

81
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,909
Ms. No.

82
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,610
I'm not asking you to understand Jae Jin.

83
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,750
But you must think about your family.

84
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,150
You mean a family for yourself.

85
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,849
I wonder if I really am part of this family.

86
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,960
("Great Expectations")

87
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,449
What did you think of the book, my son?

88
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,680
Pip, who loved Estella unconditionally...

89
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,650
for his whole life,

90
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,550
seemed so amazing.

91
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,689
No, it's not that he loved her unconditionally.

92
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,360
Only when Estella accepted his love...

93
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,029
could Pip truly love her.

94
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,430
That is a desire that has a condition.

95
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,600
Love is unconditional,

96
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,709
but desire comes with conditions. Is that what you mean?

97
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,269
I guess the two...

98
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,839
can be determined in the moment of sacrifice.

99
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,980
However, desire...

100
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,819
leads a person down a path...

101
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,379
that one never imagined.

102
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,689
Gosh.

103
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,959
Yeong Won sure is smart.

104
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,490
I give my vote to Yeong Won too.

105
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,759
- Father. - Yes? All right.

106
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,730
Let's stop reading.

107
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,670
- How about we order pizza? - Okay.

108
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,339
Instant food? No.

109
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,970
Madam Hong. Just one day won't do much harm.

110
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,540
"Just one day."

111
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,480
Why are you being like that?

112
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:10,980
Earlier, the housekeeper said...

113
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,420
that crabs were in season and was making crab soup.

114
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,120
It looked so delicious.

115
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,389
Do you like crab?

116
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,489
Okay, then. Shall we eat crab soup?

117
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,389
Okay, then. Let's do that.

118
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,560
Jae Jin, shall we go and choose another book?

119
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,699
Okay.

120
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,970
- Goodness. - Jae Jin. Are you okay?

121
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,339
You should've been more careful.

122
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,068
Yeong Won... I'm sorry.

123
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,469
No, it's okay.

124
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,909
Yeong Won, go to Jae Jin's room...

125
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,750
and change into some clothes that fit you.

126
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,879
Okay.

127
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:43,480
Let's go.

128
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,420
Gosh.

129
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,949
I wish I had a daughter like that.

130
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,120
"Just one day?"

131
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,290
You must think acting like a parent for one day makes you a parent.

132
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,939
Yeong Won, this outfit is the same as the one Seo Taiji wore.

133
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,339
Do you want to wear this?

134
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,540
- That's okay. - All right.

135
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,419
You should wear this.

136
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,489
With the beige pants you have on,

137
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,050
this denim shirt would be a better match.

138
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:23,620
Really?

139
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,529
Mom!

140
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,459
My son, you changed too.

141
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,129
Yeong Won said this shirt went better with these pants.

142
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,399
Is that so?

143
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,509
Those look great on you as if they were your own clothes.

144
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:46,279
But becoming someone who suits another person well...

145
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,850
means one must develop the mind.

146
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,649
That's why you had us read "Great Expectations."

147
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Yeong Won.

148
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,959
I'm very curious to know...

149
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,199
if you will have desire...

150
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,500
or a noble character within you.

151
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,060
You should stay for dinner.

152
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:47,869
(Chapter 7: A Sweet Hell)

153
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,268
The police have been focusing on the possibility of joint suicide...

154
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,739
for Choi and Lee, who fell into the southern sea,

155
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,410
and have been searching for their bodies.

156
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,309
After Choi's family reported that they heard from him,

157
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,949
the police have decided to call off the search.

158
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,818
And so, everything that has happened so far...

159
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,749
has turned out to be a mere happening.

160
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,659
All of the rampant rumours regarding the incident...

161
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,759
have been proven false...

162
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,100
We were caught.

163
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,730
So, you should go back now.

164
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,899
What do you mean by that?

165
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,639
Our plan failed.

166
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,639
You said so.

167
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,370
They will find us, no matter where we are, as long as we're alive.

168
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:25,610
That is true,

169
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,148
but I...

170
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:30,350
How much longer could we keep running away?

171
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,889
Isn't it better to neatly wrap things up and come back?

172
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,759
In a way, this could be...

173
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,389
your last chance...

174
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,529
to become free.

175
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,659
No, it took so much for us to get this far.

176
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,029
I will never go back! Never...

177
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,090
Gosh.

178
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,370
What are you doing?

179
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,190
You're crazy.

180
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:45,690
Crazy.

181
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,500
Jae Jin.

182
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Jae Jin.

183
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,669
Jae Jin. Oh, my dear son.

184
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,639
Are you okay?

185
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,200
Oh, dear.

186
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,779
How shameless.

187
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,980
Don't even think of coming into my house.

188
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,590
Look here, Ms. No. How is this your house?

189
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,419
How?

190
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,590
Why is this your house?

191
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,559
Jae Jin. It's fine.

192
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,860
You have me.

193
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,070
Mom.

194
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,750
Dad?

195
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,149
Do Hyun.

196
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:52,559
You're back.

197
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,690
Yes. Have you been well?

198
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,399
Do you even realize what you're doing?

199
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,419
This is what families are like.

200
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,659
Tae Oh. You understand, right?

201
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:26,389
Of course.

202
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,029
I'm so glad that he's back.

203
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,039
I'm sorry. Thank you for today, and goodbye.

204
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,840
Ms. No. Actually,

205
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,850
Do Hyun ditched cram school and spent time with me yesterday.

206
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:51,519
You know So Yi, right? Do Hyun's girlfriend.

207
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,950
Right. Do Hyun...

208
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,360
wanted to introduce her to you and Jae Jin.

209
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,629
But he was frustrated that the situation went wrong.

210
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:07,529
So I treated him to something tasty to cheer him up.

211
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,999
I see.

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,798
Of course, it was wrong of him to ditch cram school.

213
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,039
But it was because he cared for you, so if you could...

214
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:21,009
- Thanks for telling me. - No problem.

215
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,149
I don't want to keep...

216
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,490
any secrets from you.

217
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,350
I see.

218
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,360
If anything like this happens again, please do the same.

219
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,600
Of course. I'll get going.

220
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,049
I'm sorry, son.

221
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,220
You also had an affair?

222
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,289
So it's true.

223
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,200
I thought you and I...

224
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:15,830
were both in the palm of Mom's hand.

225
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,500
It seems you weren't.

226
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,669
Right now,

227
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,809
I have nothing to tell you.

228
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:29,850
Later when you grow up a little,

229
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,080
you might be able to understand me.

230
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,389
Are you going to divorce her?

231
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,889
Do Hyun.

232
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,429
No matter what happens,

233
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:49,129
I'll always be your dad. That will never change.

234
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,000
I'll be on your side at all times.

235
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,169
So I...

236
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:02,210
want you to live the way you want.

237
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,149
You didn't live the way you wanted?

238
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,779
I am...

239
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,620
honestly not even sure what I've wanted in life.

240
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,529
I'd like to find it.

241
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:22,870
How have you been?

242
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,399
The truth is, I...

243
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,940
Never mind. Deal with your issues first.

244
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,479
I'll tell you later.

245
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,179
Why? Tell me. Are you up to something?

246
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,679
Did you break up with So Yi? Is that it?

247
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:44,859
Why would I break up with her? We're a happy couple.

248
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,990
I see. That's great.

249
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,889
- You should get out now. - Okay.

250
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,179
Why don't we have a talk?

251
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,279
Toast.

252
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,190
It's such a relief that Dr. Choi is back safely.

253
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,429
Right, Ms. No?

254
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,809
You look so haggard. You must've gone through a lot.

255
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,039
Have you been eating properly?

256
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,048
Tell us how you have been.

257
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,179
Mother.

258
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,079
It's not like he's back from a trip.

259
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,080
We aren't gathered here for some heroic stories.

260
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:54,388
I truly feel sorry to the two of you.

261
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,860
Of course, you should.

262
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,329
Ms. No. He says he's sorry.

263
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,628
I didn't intend this at first.

264
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,169
Then, you shouldn't have done what you didn't intend.

265
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:09,408
Ms. No. He says he didn't intend this.

266
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,740
Mother, I can hear him.

267
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,940
Right? Anyway...

268
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,249
Dr. Choi, you're wrong about what you did this time.

269
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,580
It's your fault for being naive enough to be deceived.

270
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,750
Even if...

271
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,289
Lee Se Na approached you intentionally,

272
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:29,129
it doesn't change the fact that you deceived me.

273
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:32,659
On top of that, you gained reputation...

274
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,129
even by doing ghost surgery for such a long time.

275
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,940
That disappoints me even more.

276
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,570
You're not even curious to know...

277
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,508
why I had to do that, are you?

278
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:48,250
No matter what the reason was,

279
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,279
your actions can't be justified.

280
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:55,320
Don't even try to make cowardly excuses.

281
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,059
Right. I'm not going to make excuses anymore.

282
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,930
Dr. Choi, do you still not know it?

283
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:12,038
Lee Se Na...

284
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,038
seduced you...

285
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,038
to break our family apart.

286
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,680
Mother. What do you think she can possibly do to our family?

287
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,609
Oh, Lord.

288
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,150
Save this young lamb who has fallen prey to the Evil One.

289
00:17:58,349 --> 00:17:59,848
(Name: Lee Se Na)

290
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:01,390
(Mental instability, panic disorder, obsession, cognitive distortion)

291
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:08,890
Here.

292
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:12,559
These are the charts from your old counselling TV shows.

293
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,230
- You asked for these, right? - Yes.

294
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,470
This show aired such a long time ago.

295
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:21,640
They must be all grownups now.

296
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,910
I wonder if they are doing well in life.

297
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,119
You never say anything recklessly,

298
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,690
so I've acted like I didn't know.

299
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,289
Just what is going on with you?

300
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:49,670
"Lee Se Na?"

301
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes.

302
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,869
Lee Se Na is...

303
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,880
blackmailing me.

304
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,179
(The 2nd Half of 2010)

305
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,809
Would she really be one of them?

306
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,279
No one seems to be a match based on the basic information.

307
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:12,359
Anyway, once you find out why she's blackmailing you,

308
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,160
what will you do?

309
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,230
I think...

310
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,799
I need to know why...

311
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,069
to be able to stop her.

312
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:41,389
Francesca, why haven't you visited for so long?

313
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,420
My business trip took a long time.

314
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,690
Of your eight years of volunteer work,

315
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,230
you haven't visited us for the longest time.

316
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,259
Has it already been eight years?

317
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,799
Of course.

318
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,669
May I stay here for a few days?

319
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,869
Of course.

320
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,739
- Auntie! - Auntie!

321
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,509
- Auntie! - I missed you.

322
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,308
- I brought gifts for you. - There are some here too.

323
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,309
Here.

324
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,890
May is in a bad mood today.

325
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,890
Ta-da. It's a gift for you.

326
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:32,140
You wanted this for your birthday.

327
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,200
My mom said she'd come for me...

328
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:37,210
when I turned seven.

329
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,309
Do you still believe it?

330
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,779
She promised me.

331
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,519
You promised me too.

332
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,890
That you'd hate those who abandon you.

333
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:57,690
Does her not keeping her promise mean she abandoned me?

334
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,240
Don't worry.

335
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:13,710
You won't have to promise anything that you can't keep.

336
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,950

I talked to Jun O on the phone last night.

No.

348
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:54,750

479

00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,079
You cooked so much.

Why is this...

488
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,190
Nothing in season.

489

Do you find it absurd?

490
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:48,180
But you know what? These dishes are...

491
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,849
my favourites.

492
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,319
They're something...

493
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:56,089
I could never have in this house.

494

495
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,859
revealing your taste?

496
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,670

My whole life was a lie.

499

At home, I was a kind son,

500
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,250
and a nice husband.

501
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:24,049
And outside,

502
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:26,890
I was a fake doctor who made Dr. Oh...

503
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,559
perform my surgeries instead.

504
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:36,430
What are you doing?

505
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,230
What?

506
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,440
Then are you saying...

507
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,369
you're a fake doctor?

508
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:46,609
See?

509
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,410
I asked you how Jae Jin had become a doctor.

510
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,880
I couldn't become a doctor.

511
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:56,250
And yet, Mother,

512
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,519
you made me into a doctor.

513
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:01,220
You even made me use a substitute surgeon to do my surgeries.

514
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:06,029
You made me continue living a lie.

515
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:10,700
I knew you were a scary person,

516
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:13,269
but how could you fake that?

517
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,140
Dr. Choi.

518
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,680
I get that you want to be honest with your family,

519
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,349
Dr. Choi.

520
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,150
Well, since we all know now,

521
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:33,558
we can understand how he feels as a family.

522
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,619
Mother.

523
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:38,900
There was something else you've been hiding, Mother.

524
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:43,700
Listen to me carefully.

525
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,339
When Father-in-law passed away,

526
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,839
he was wrongly framed.

527
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:55,109
My father was involved in doing so.

528
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:02,019
He knew it was false,

529
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:06,559
but my father was the accomplice who framed him for sexual abuse.

530
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,859
Jae Jin, what are you saying?

531
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,069
My dad was framed?

532
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,569
I'm sorry, Young Min. I...

533
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,839
I was wondering how my brother died by being hit by a stone.

534
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,009
But if this came to light...

535
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,278
Maybe my brother really did get hit by a stone.

536
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,419
Dr. Choi, I think you should stop now.

537
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,519
No.

538
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,619
I don't want to.

539
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,690
The highlight still remains.

540
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,730
You knew about all of this and wanted to keep it secret.

541
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:52,400
That was why she brought you into our family.

542
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,299
My life, yours,

543
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:57,769
and even our marriage...

544
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,609
were all planned by Mother.

545
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:07,319
No. That's not true.

546
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,259
That was really Prosecutor Choi's doing, all on his own.

547
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,259
- I just did what I thought was... - Do you know...

548
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,730
how disgusting and nasty your hypocrisy is as you care for Ms. No?

549
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:20,730
You made it seem like a suicide,

550
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,768
but you pretend to be a good father-in-law.

551
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,170
It sickens me.

552
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:26,670
"It sickens you?"

553
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,309
Have you forgotten that you were an accomplice too?

554
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,379
You said the more it felt leery, the closer we had to keep her.

555
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,110
Who was it that said we should bring her over?

556
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,609
Who even got her to marry Jae Jin?

557
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,550
And why did I do that? Why?

558
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:02,869
It's all over, Yeong Won.

559
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:06,710
We're not the family you think we are.

560
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,019
Jae Jin.

561
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:31,400
Wait. But... Are you all leaving?

562
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:37,869
I'm so proud. I didn't think he'd actually pull it off.

563
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,579
- Jae Jin. - Mother.

564
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,989
Even in this situation, you only worry about your son, right?

565
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,920
You only lied to me until the end.

566
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,130
But still, at least Jae Jin...

567
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,829
was honest with me today.

568
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:11,309
Sa Kang, are you okay?

569
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:15,678
Still, you and Go Myeon were a couple, at least.

570
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,949
You even had a secret that you kept together.

571
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,690
I'll be going. Goodbye.

572
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,900
Was this why you came back?

573
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,670
Yes, this was why I came back.

574
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,739
To reveal all the dirty truth about our family.

575
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:50,448
I wanted to free you who has known nothing...

576
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:51,880
throughout your whole life.

577
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,119
And I want to become free from this too.

578
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,119
I won't live as the fake Choi Jae Jin any longer.

579
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:02,259
If being fake was tormenting you, you could've spoken up before too.

580
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,690
Why didn't I speak up?

581
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,860
Why did I just live like this all this time?

582
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:09,099
The ideal son that Mother wanted.

583
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,899
I had to live as the ideal husband you wanted me to be.

584
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,300
That was the way to protect this family.

585
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:17,869
The real Choi Jae Jin...

586
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,610
wants to be free.

587
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:25,820
Did you have an affair because you wanted to be free?

588
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,979
And even fake your own suicide?

589
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,050
That's right.

590
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:31,619
I'm dirty.

591
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:35,090
I can't stand it any longer either.

592
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,789
That's why I'm trying to end things like this.

593
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,879
Get to your senses!

594
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,710
You're being gaslighted by Lee Se Na.

595
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,749
She sent you here on purpose to ruin our family.

596
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,590
No! This was my choice!

597
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,489
My choice.

598
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:36,050
Yes, I'm heading there right now.

599
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,750
I'll be there soon.

600
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:03,010
I survived again.

601
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:06,510
You can't die. Not yet.

602
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:18,750
The ones who are tormenting you are your family members.

603
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,920
Why are you trying to die?

604
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,559
You can just cut ties and become free from your family.

605
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,199
Se Na.

606
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,929
You say that because you don't know my family very well.

607
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,639
How much longer will you live in the play written by your mom?

608
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,440
You know it too.

609
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:38,909
That's not the real you.

610
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,250
There is a story you don't know.

611
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:48,780
Something only I know.

612
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,690
Why did you only tell me this now?

613
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,230
My parents were monsters too.

614
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,000
But I became free from my parents.

615
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,769
So, you can also...

616
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,610
become free.

617
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:16,449
If Yeong Won were to find out about this...

618
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,179
No Yeong Won is a pitiful person too, just like you.

619
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,320
We need to free her.

620
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:31,230
You will save everyone, just like that.

621
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,059
Just like you saved me.

622
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:38,030
And then,

623
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,139
we can see each other again.

624
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:51,480
Yes, I'm heading there right now.

625
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:52,949
I'll be there soon.

I'm here.

631
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:43,289
You wanted to see me at the airport, so I thought we'd leave right away.

632
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,019
We have things left to do.

Stop pestering me.

636
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,329
We're going to be together forever.

637
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,559
You should be able to wait for a short time.

638
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,199
Sorry.

639
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:01,539

you know how much pain No Yeong Won...

643
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,789
caused me.

644
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,900
This is the only way to cure me.

645
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,400
Otherwise, I'll be dead.

646
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,969

I will... I'll do my best.

648
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,079
Maybe we should...

649
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,309
install a secret camera in the living room too.

650

00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:31,238
(Right, you don't have to know everything about your family.)

673
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:32,510
(But then, I wondered how it'd be if they did know everything.)

674
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:36,210
Lee Se Na sent these texts...

675
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:37,909
at 5:09pm.

676
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,819
(Se Na)

677
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,980
It was soon after the clock hit five.

678
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,460
And he left the house as he dialled her number...

679
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,359
at 5:30pm.

680
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,558
(Se Na)

681
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,659
This means...

682
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,730
When you told the truth to the family,

683
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:00,169
was Lee Se Na watching it?

684
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,699
Or did you just agree to meet up there?

685
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:05,139
Answer me already!

686
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:11,849
I was supposed to call her after everything was over...

687
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,650
so that we could meet up at the promised location afterward.

688
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,590
(J Plastic and Reconstruction Surgery Center)

689
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,469
She was watching it all.

690
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,480
"My kids were..."

691
00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:47,250
"just like their father."

692
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,189
"They couldn't be spiteful."

693
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,190
(Soft Hands)

694
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:53,760
"They were too soft-hearted."

695
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,559
"The family was so poor..."

696
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,900
"that they couldn't be educated enough."

697
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,699
"Without getting to work under the shade,"

698
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,929
"they work under the burning sun to make a living."

699
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:10,440
"My heart breaks when the sun is hot."

700
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,309
"As their mother myself,"

701
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,610
"I feel so ashamed..."

702
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,050
"and guilty."

703
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,920
I remember...

704
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,760
when my father...

705
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:29,219
first brought you.

706
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:30,989
It was...

707
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,929
soon after you entered college.

708
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,969
You were reading a book in the garden.

709
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:42,070
In my under-educated eyes,

710
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,840
you seemed...

711
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:48,440
noble.

712
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,449
That fantasy must've been broken...

713
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,420
as you spent time with my family.

714
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:00,420
My father wasn't an upright prosecutor.

715
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,019
He generously took me in.

716
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:05,829
If it hadn't been for him,

717
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:07,929
my life...

718
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:10,429
would've been much worse.

719
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,139
Instead, you covered up...

720
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,010
all the dirty secrets of my family.

721
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,750
And coincidentally at a time like this,

722
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:27,050
you showed up for me again.

723
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,719
That was exactly what I wanted.

724
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,159
So don't feel burdened.

725
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:37,789
Look.

726
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,269
I certainly detested my father...

727
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:48,739
because I knew nothing was more sorrowful...

728
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,710
than detesting one's own parent.

729
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,619
Will Jae Jin feel the same about me?

730
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:04,389
Dr. Choi...

731
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,889
will understand it one day.

732
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:13,460
The heart of a mother.

733
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:23,039
You must feel empty.

734
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:26,269
Have a warm bowl of soup.

735
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,519
- Dr. No, you're inside, right? - Yes.

736
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,789
Hi.

737
00:55:54,219 --> 00:55:57,659
I was looking into her as well.

738
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:00,400
It turned out she was a very scary woman.

739
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,099
All of her husbands died.

740
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:07,269
- I know. - You do?

741
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:14,079
But that wasn't it.

742
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:18,050
She was investigated when her third husband was burned to death.

743
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,750
She seemed crazy.

744
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:26,219
You must've liked your sister a lot.

745
00:56:26,489 --> 00:56:27,690
My sister was...

746
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,260
pretty.

747
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:33,929
That's what they always said.

748
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:36,429
I...

749
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,840
I also liked...

750
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:44,010
my sister.

751
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,280
So, I tried to protect her.

752
00:56:47,809 --> 00:56:50,710
Did something happen to your sister?

753
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,210
They died. All three of them.

754
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,820
In a plane accident.

755
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:02,719
My dad, my mom,

756
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,929
and my sister.

757
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:13,170
Did you kill a cat?

758
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,909
It hurt my sister.

759
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:18,869
She admitted it!

760
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,739
She just said she killed the cat.

761
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:26,209
But everyone said I had done something wrong.

762
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,679
All I wanted to do was protect my family.

763
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,249
I also got rid of everything...

764
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,760
my husband hated.

765
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:40,730
Ms. Lee, I think you should get professional help.

766
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:44,030
Being overly obsessed with love...

767
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:53,739
Look at that. She's a total psychopath.

768
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:56,638
Leaving a woman like this alone...

769
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,110
could put Ji Eun in danger.

770
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:03,449
You didn't know that this woman smacked Ji Eun down with a shovel,

771
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,019
did you?

772
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:08,289
- I heard about it. - You did?

773
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,429
Dr. Oh told me.

774
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:13,729
Anyway, I can't let a person like this...

775
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:17,000
be on the loose as a police officer!

776
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:22,238
That is why I looked into her a bit more.

777
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,539
There's more you need to see.

778
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:28,639
This happened 14 years ago in Gangneung.

779
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,250
There was a fire that killed a whole family.

780
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,749
The parents and their daughter. All three of them...

781
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,050
were found dead in the same room.

782
00:58:39,489 --> 00:58:41,619
The cause of the fire could not be identified.

783
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:45,159
It was a case that was known as an unfortunate family accident.

784
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:47,500
What about this incident?

785
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,429
The headline was this. "A family disaster."

786
00:58:54,269 --> 00:58:56,699
But there wasn't...

787
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,840
one daughter in that family.

788
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:02,480
There were two daughters.

789
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,710
The daughter who died in the fire was the eldest daughter.

790
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,979
Then was the second daughter...

791
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,789
Yes! It was Lee Se Na!

792
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,590
Lee Se Na was the only one that wasn't in the house.

793
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:16,018
According to the investigation records,

794
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:19,559
she was sleeping in the yard because of her sleepwalking.

795
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:22,129
You said the cause of the fire wasn't identified, right?

796
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,130
It wasn't identified.

797
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,570
A particular cause of the fire wasn't found on the site.

798
00:59:26,869 --> 00:59:29,169
An the only survivor, Lee Se Na,

799
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,839
wasn't sane enough to participate...

800
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,610
in the investigation.

801
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:37,609
What happened to her after that?

802
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,380
She was adopted by a family in Norway.

803
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:43,480
I think that was how...

804
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:45,719
that case ended.

805
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,789
But in the video we just saw,

806
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:59,329
why did she say her family died in a plane accident?

807
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,769
They died. All three of them. In a plane accident.

808
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,579
I'm not sure if her memories were distorted by the shock...

809
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,510
or if she was just lying deliberately.

810
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:17,320
But seeing how violent she can get with her obsession with love...

811
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,360
shows that she's clearly a dangerous person.

812
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,809
My sister was...

813
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:43,039
pretty.

814
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,480
So, I tried to protect her.

815
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,719
There was a fire that killed a whole family in Gangneung.

816
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:53,788
They died. All three of them.

817
01:00:53,789 --> 01:00:56,718
The parents and their daughter. All three of them.

818
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:00,659
My dad, my mom,

819
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,500
and my sister.

820
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:32,690
Why did you kill your sister you liked so much?

821
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,139
(Dr. No Yeong Won)

822
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:26,679
(Bitter Sweet Hell)

823
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:57,149
Lee Se Na was spying on this house through this camera.

824
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,509
You should be the one to find them.

825
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,209
How dare she give me orders?

826
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,678
You believe there's an insider that is helping Lee Se Na, right?

827
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,719
It's definitely someone close to us.

828
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,419
Do you know everything about Do Hyun?

829
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,118
- It has been 11 weeks. - Lee Se Na?

830
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,589
Did you pay her to get rid of the baby?

831
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:11,859
It's my choice to make.

832
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:15,428
Maternal instinct is such a beautiful but sad thing, isn't it?

833
01:03:15,429 --> 01:03:17,399
The game will now start to get fun.

834
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,328
Lee Se Na is threatening my child.

835
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:21,768
Her sister was alive.

836
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:23,908
She said her younger sister started the fire.

837
01:03:23,909 --> 01:03:25,509
And that she wanted to kill their parents.
